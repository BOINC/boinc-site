<h2>Preferences</h2> 
<p>
Participants can specify <b>preferences</b> determining and limiting
how BOINC uses their computers.
Preferences are divided into three groups: 
<ul>
<li> <b>Work preferences</b>
<ul>
<li> Whether work (computation and network transfer) should be done
while the host is being used (i.e. during keyboard and mouse input).
<li> Whether work should be done while the computer is being powered
by batteries (for laptop users).
<li> Whether to wait for user confirmation before making network connections.
<li> Minimum and maximum amounts of work to maintain on disk.
These values are expressed as time values X and Y.
The client will try to ensure it
has at least enough work to keep it busy for X days, and at most Y days.
If the host is frequently disconnected from the Internet, X
should be at least as long as the typical period of disconnection.
The larger the difference between X and Y, the less often
BOINC will connect to the Internet.
</ul>
<li> <b>Disk preferences</b>
BOINC's usage of disk space can be limited in one or more of the
following ways: 
<ul>
<li> Maximum disk space used by BOINC.
<li> Maximum percentage of free space used by BOINC.
<li> Minimum disk space to keep free.
</ul>
<li> <b>Project preferences</b> (one set for each project)
<ul>
<li> Master URL of project
<li> Email address
<li> Account ID
<li> Resource share: if projects contend for resources,
the amount allocated to a project is proportional to this number.
<li> Whether to show email address on web site
<li> Whether project should send emails to user
<li> Project-specific preferences
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Each participant has a single set of preferences.
If you want to have different preferences for different hosts,
you must create a separate account. 

<h3>Propagation of preferences</h3> 
<p>
The BOINC client stores a copy of the preferences.
Whenever a host contacts a scheduling server, the request
message includes the preferences and their last-modification time.
If the server has a more recently modified version of the preferences,
it returns these to the client.
Thus a change to preferences is eventually propagated to all hosts,
and to the databases of all enrolled projects.
A participant may edit preferences on the web site of any enrolled project;
however, care should be taken to ensure that a change isn't
overwritten by an earlier change.
The easiest way to do this is to edit preferences only at one web site.
