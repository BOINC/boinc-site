<h2>Preferences</h2>

<p>
Participants can create "preference sets"
describing their resource usage policy.
A preference set includes the following:

<ul>
<li> Whether work (computation and network transfer)
should be done while that host is in use
(i.e. while keyboard and mouse events are going on).

<li> Whether work should be done while the
computer is being powered by batteries.

<li> How much disk space should be used by BOINC.

<li> How much network bandwidth should be used.

</ul>

<p>
A user can maintain multiple preference sets,
and can independently associate hosts with preference sets.

<p>
These preferences apply uniformly to all projects.

<p>
In addition, projects can define their own application-specific
preferences (e.g., choice of color scheme).
<b>This needs to be fleshed out.</b>
