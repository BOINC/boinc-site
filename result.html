<h2>Results</h2> 
<p>
A <b>result</b> describes an instance of a computation, either unstarted,
in progress, or completed.
The attributes of a result include:

<dl>
<dt><b>name</b><dd>
The name of the result (unique across all results in the project). 
<dt><b>workunit name</b><dd>
<dt><b>output files</b><dd>
A list of the names of the output files,
and the names by which the application refers to them.
<dt><b>state</b><dd>
Values include: 
<ul>
    <li> Inactive (not ready to dispatch) 
    <li> Unsent (ready to dispatch, but not dispatched) 
    <li> In progress (dispatched, not done) 
    <li> Done successfully 
    <li> Timed out 
    <li> Done with error 
</ul>
<dt><b>host</b><dd>
The host that executed the computation.
<dt><b>CPU time</b><dd>
The CPU time that was used.
<dt><b>exit status</b><dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following attributes are defined after the result is completed:
<ul>
<li> An XML document giving the sizes and checksums of its output
files (filled in after the result is completed). 
<li> The stderr output of the result. 
<li> The host that was sent the result.
<li> The times when the result was received. 
</ul>
<p>
Results are normally created using the
<a href=tools_work.html>create_work</a> utility.
<p>
The XML document listing the output files has the form: <pre>
&lt;file_info>...&lt;/file_info>
[ ... ]
&lt;result>
    &lt;name>foobar&lt;/name>
    &lt;wu_name>blah&lt;/wu_name>
    &lt;exit_status>blah&lt;/exit_status>
    &lt;file_ref>...&lt;/file_ref>
    [ ... ]
&lt;/result>
</pre>
The components are: 
<ul>
<li> The <b>&lt;name></b> element is the result name. 
<li> The <b>&lt;wu_name></b> element is the workunit name. 
<li> Each <b>&lt;file_ref></b> element is an association to an
output file, described by a corresponding <b>&lt;file_info></b> element. 
</ul>
<p>
The XML document describing the sizes and checksums of the output
files is just a list of <b>&lt;file_info></b> elements, with the
<b>nbytes</b> and <b>md5_cksum</b> fields present.
The project back end
must parse this field to find the locations and checksums of output files.
