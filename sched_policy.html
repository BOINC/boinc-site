<h2>Scheduling server: policy</h2>

<p>
The scheduling server will attempt to send enough work to excede a hosts high
water mark. If the amount of work the scheduling server is sending excedes four
weeks, the scheduling server will not attach more work to a scheduler reply. 
This does not prevent the scheduling server from sending a work unit that takes
more than four weeks, but merely from attaching more work after a scheduler
reply has four weeks of work. If a work unit uses more disk resources than a
host has available, the scheduling server will not attach that work unit. The
scheduling server estimates the amount of time a work unit will take to
complete with the formula <b>(number of fpops)/(fpops per second)+(number of
iops)/(iops per second)</b>. The number of fpops and number of iops are 
provided by the backend when creating the work unit, and the calculation speeds
are included in a scheduler request. If no work is available, the scheduling
server sends the message <tt>no work available</tt> with priority <tt>low</tt>,
and requests that the client wait before sending another scheduler request.
