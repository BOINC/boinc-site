<h2>Platform Specific BOINC Optimization</h2>
<p>
There are currently no plans to do official BOINC releases
optimized for specific platforms.
Since BOINC uses so little
CPU time, the savings from this would be on the order of
CPU seconds per actual days.
<p>
Developers may compile
their own version of the BOINC client optimized for a specific platform.
<p>
Projects which use the BOINC infrastructure may release
their applications in optimized form.
Care should be taken
to ensure the optimized versions are sent only to the
proper processors.
