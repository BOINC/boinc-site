<h2>Test applications and scripts</h2>

<p>
The <b>apps</b> directory contains the following test applications:

<ul>
<li> <b>concat</b>: concatenates its input files.
Input and output filenames are passed on the command line.
<li> <b>upper_case</b>: reads from stdin, converts to upper case,
writes to stdout.
<li> <b>uc_slow</b>: like upper_case, but processes
only one character per second.
Checkpoints every 5 characters.
Restartable.
</ul>

The <b>test</b> directory contains PHP scripts,
together with XML templates and sample input files,
for initializing and testing the entire system:

<ul>
<li> <b>test_uc.php</b>: tests I/O connection using descriptors.
<li> <b>test_concat.php</b>: tests I/O connection using command-line args
and filenames.
<li> <b>test_uc_slow.php</b>: tests checkpoint/restart.
You have to run the client yourself,
kill and restart it a few times.
<li> <b>test_prefs.php</b>: tests some aspects of preferences.
<li> <b>test_api.php</b>: tests to ensure the api is working properly.
<li> <b>test_water.php</b>: tests some aspects of water marks.
<li> <b>test_rsc.php</b>: tests that scheduling server only sends feasable work units. 
</ul>

<p>
These scripts use functions defined in the PHP include file
<b>init.inc</b>.
You can use these functions to easily write test scripts
for your own applications.
