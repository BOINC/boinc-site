<h2>Workunit scheduling parameters</h2

<p>
BOINC

<p>
Each workunit has several parameters related to redundancy and scheduling.
Values for these parameters are supplied by the project
when the workunit is created

<dl>
<dt>
<b>delay_bound</b>
<dd>
An upper bound on the time (in seconds) between sending
a result to a client and receiving a reply.
The scheduler won't issue a result if the estimated
completion time exceeds this.
Set this to several times the average execution time
of a workunit on a typical PC.
If you set it too low,
BOINC may not be able to send some results,
and the corresponding workunit will be flagged with an error.
If you set it too high,
there may a corresponding delay in getting results back.
<dt>
<b>min_quorum</b>
<dd>
The minimum size of a quorum.
Set this to two or more if you want redundant computing.
<dt>
<b>target_nresults</b>
<dd>
How many successful results to get.
This must be at least <b>min_quorum</b>.
It may be more to reflect the ratio of result loss,
or to get a quorum more quickly.
<dt>
<b>max_error_results</b>
<dd>
If the number of client error results exceeds this,
the work unit is declared to have an error;
no further results are issued, and the assimilator is triggered.
This safeguards against workunits that exercise a bug
in the application.
<dt>
<b>max_total_results</b>
<dd>
If the total number of results for this workunit exceeds this,
the workunit is declared to be in error.
<dt>
<b>max_success_results</b>
<dd>
If the number of success results for this workunit exceeds this,
and a consensus has not been reached,
the workunit is declared to be in error.
</dl>
