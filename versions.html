<h2>Versioning mechanisms</h2>

<p>
BOINC is designed to accommodate evolution
of both the infrastructure (the core client and scheduling server)
and of applications.

<p>
Projects are free to release as many application versions as they like.
All core client releases should be coordinated through
the BOINC project at U.C. Berkeley.

<p>
Each core client version in the BOINC database
has the following attributes:
<ul>
<li> <b>message</b>: if the scheduling server gets a request
from this version of the core client, it returns this message
(e.g., suggesting that the user update the core client).
<li> <b>deprecated</b>: if true, this instructs the
scheduling server to not send any work to hosts running this version.
</ul>
<p>
Each application version has the following attributes:
<ul>
<li> <b>min core version</b>: Don't run the application
on core clients earlier than this.
<li> <b>max core version</b>: If nonzer, don't run the application
on core clients later than this.
</ul>
