<title>Validation of results and credit</title>

<h2>Validation of results and credit</h2>
<p>
Communication from the core client can easily be altered or forged.
Some users will attempt to get undeserved credit
by falsifying their CPU metrics or CPU times.
Output files may be wrong.
This can result from tampering or hardware failures.
<p>
Both problems - credit-cheating and wrong results - can be addressed
by <b>redundant computing</b> and <b>result validation</b>.
In this approach, each workunit is processed at least twice.
The project back end waits until a minimum number of results have been returned,
then compares the results and decides which are considered correct.
The notion of equality of results,
and the policy for deciding which are correct,
are project-specific.
<p>
The back end then marks correct results as "validated",
finds the minimum reported credit for the correct results of a given workunit,
and assigns this amount of credit to all the correct results.
This ensures that as long as a reasonable majority of participants
don't falsify credit, almost all credit accounting will be correct.

<h3>The validation program</h3>

BOINC supplies a utility program <b>validate</b>
to perform validation and credit-granting.
This program must be linked with two project-specific functions:
<pre>
int check_set(vector<RESULT> results, int& canonicalid, double& credit);
int check_pair(RESULT& r1, RESULT& r2, bool& match);
</pre>
<b>check_set()</b> takes a set of results.
If there is sufficient agreement,
it selects one of them as the "canonical" result
(returning its ID) and also decides what credit should
be granted for correct results for this workunit.
<p>
<b>check_pair()</b> compares two results and returns match=true
if they agree.

<p>
The file <b>validate_test.C</b> contains an example
implementation of check_set() and check_pair().

<h3>Implementation</h3>

The following database fields are used:

<p>
<b>WORKUNIT</b>
<dt> bool need_validate
<dd>
        true iff this workunit has one or more results in state DONE
        and validate_state UNCHECKED
<dt>
    int canonical_resultid
<dd>
        nonzero if a conclusive check has been done for this WU;
        indicates the canonical result
                            
<p>
<b>RESULT</b>
<dt>
    int state
<dd> INACTIVE, ..., DONE, ERROR
<dt>
    int validate_state
<dd>
        NEED_CHECK,
        VALID,
        INVALID
