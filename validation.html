<h2>Accounting and Result Validation</h2> 
<p>
	Participants are given <b>credit</b> for the computations performed
by their hosts. These credits are used to generate "leaderboards" of
individuals, teams, and categories (countries, CPU types, etc.). It is
to be expected that users will explore ways of "cheating", i.e. getting
undeserved credit. 
</p>
<p>
	In principles credit should reflect network transfers and disk
storage as well as computation. However, it's hard to verify these
activities, so they aren't included in credit. 
</p>
<p>
	The core client assigns credit for a completed work unit as a
function of the CPU time used, and the performance metrics of the CPU
(discussed later). This is sent back to the scheduling server; of
course, the number can't be trusted in general.
</p>
<p>
	Output files may be wrong. This can happen because of hardware
failures, or because of tampering.
</p>
<p>
	Both problems - credit-cheating and wrong result - can be addressed
by <b>redundant computing</b> and <b>result validation</b>. This means
that each workunit is processed at least twice. The project back end
waits until a minimum number of results have been returned, then
compares the results and decides which are "correct". The notion of
"equality" of results, and the policy for deciding which are correct,
are project-specific. 
</p>
<p>
	The back end then marks correct results as "validated", finds the
minimum reported credit for the correct results of a given workunit, and
assigns this amount of credit to all the correct results. This ensures
that as long as a reasonable majority of participants don't falsify
credit, almost all credit accounting will be correct. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>To do</b>: database keeps track of two types of credit: validated
and unvalidated. Users can see the workunits that didn't pass
validation, or that were given reduced credit.
