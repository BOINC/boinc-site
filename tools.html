<h2>BOINC operational tools</h2>

<p>
BOINC provides various tools for creating and operating projects.
These tools are accessed in several ways:

<ul>
<li> Via a web interface.
These scripts are in the html_ops directory.
They are accessable only by users with the "manager" rights.
<li> Application programs.
These can be invoked from scripting languages.
<li> C++ functions.
</ul>

<hr>
The C++ library (backend_lib.C,h) provides the following function:
<pre>
int create_work(
    int appid,
    char* wu_name,
    char* wu_template,
    char* result_template,
    int nresults,
    char* infile_dir,
    char** infiles,
    int ninfiles
);
</pre>

<p>
This creates a workunit and one or more results.
<p>
"appid" is the database ID of the application.
<p>
"wu_name" is the name of the workunit.
<p>
"wu_name" is the filename of a template for the
workunit XML document.
This template is macro-substituted as follows:
<ul>
<li> INFILE_n is replaced with the name of the nth input file.
<li> MD5_n is replaced with the MD5 checksum of the nth input file.
<li> WU_NAME is replaced with the workunit name.
</ul>
<p>
"result_template" is the filename of a template for the
result XML document.
This template is macro-substituted as follows:
<ul>
<li> OUTFILE_n is replaced with a string of the form
"wuname_resultnum_n" where wuname is the workunit name and
resultnum is the ordinal number of the result (0, 1, ...).
<li> WU_NAME is replaced with the workunit name.
<li> RESULT_NAME is replaced with a string of the form "wuname_resultnum".
</ul>
<p>
"nresults" is the number of results to be created.
<p>
"infile_dir" is the path of the directory where the input files are.
<p>
"infiles" is an array of names of the input files,
of length "ninfiles".

<hr>
The program
<pre>
create_work -appname file -wu_name file -wu_template file -result_template file -nresults n infile1 infile2 ...
</pre>
is a command-line equivalent of the create_work() function.

<p>
The program "add" performs various types of initialization:
<dl>
<dt>
add app name
<dd>
Create an application record.
<dt>
add platform name
<dd>
Create a platform record
<dt>
add app_version app-name platform-name version-num exec-dir exec-filename
<dd>
Create an app_version record.
<dt>
add user email_addr name web_password authenticator
<dd>
Create a user record.
<dt>
add prefs email_addr file
<dd>
Create a preference set, and make it the default
preferences for the given user.

</dl>
