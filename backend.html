<h2>The components of a project back end</h2>

<p>
The <b>back end</b> of a BOINC project consists
of a number of components that together are responsible
for generating work and absorbing the results.
Some of these components are supplied by BOINC;
other parts are project- or application-specific:

<th>BOINC-supplied part</th>
<th>project-supplied part</th>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Work generator</b>: generates work units and their input files,
and generates one or more results per work unit.
</td>
<td>
Functions and programs that handle the details of
creating workunit and result database records.
</td>
<td>
Programs or scripts that generate input files,
install them on data servers,
and call the BOINC functions.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Result retry generator</b>:
generates additional results if some of those initially sent are lost.</td>
<td>A program, <b>result_retry</b>, that does the job.</td>
<td>Some parameters used by result_retry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Result validation and accounting</b>:
compare redundant results; select a <b>canonical result</b>
representing the correct output,
and a <b>canonical credit</b> granted to users and hosts
that return the correct output.</td>
<td>A program, <b>validate</b>, that contains the
basic logic for validation.</td>
<td>An application-specific function, linked with <b>validate</b>,
that compares sets of redundant results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Result processing</b>: parse output files of
completed results, and take appropriate action
(record results in a database, and/or generate more work)</td>
<td>Function for enumerating unprocessed results.</td>
<td>The rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Garbage collector</b>: delete input and output files
when they are no longer needed.</td>
<td>A program, <b>garbage_collect</b>, that does the job.</td>
<td>None.</td>
</tr>
