<h2>Employment</h2>
<p>
<b> 2002 - present: Research Scientist, Space Sciences Lab, U.C. Berkeley</b>
<p>
I direct <a href=https://boinc.berkeley.edu>BOINC</a>,
a research project that develops middleware for volunteer computing.
BOINC is used by SETI@home, Climateprediction.net, Einstein@home,
and about 30 other scientific computing projects from universities
and research labs around the world.
I am Principal Investigator or co-PI on six National Science
Foundation grants supporting BOINC.
<p>
From 1997 to 2016 I directed
<a href=https://setiathome.berkeley.edu>SETI@home</a>,
a research project
that uses volunteer computing to analyze data
from the Arecibo radio telescope
in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).
Since its public launch in May 1999,
over 3,000,000 people have contributed 2 million years of computer time,
making SETI@home the largest computation ever performed.
As project director, I raised funds
(about $2M thus far, from a variety of private and public sources),
hired and managed a team of 6 programmers and system administrators,
handled news media, and managed the web site.
I was also the technical lead,
designing and managing the implementation of the client-
and server-side software, and the database.
I managed the transition of SETI@home to the BOINC platform.
I am currently developing
<a href=https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/nebula/>Nebula</a>,
a system for the back-end analysis of SETI@home results.

<p>
I worked on the
<a href=https://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/>Stardust@home</a>
project, led by Andrew Westphal at SSL,
developing the "virtual microscope" technology
enabling volunteers to look for particles of interstellar dust
in microphotographs of an Aerogel collector.

<p>
<b>Jan - Oct 2002: Chief Science Officer, United Devices</b>
<p>
I provided strategic consulting for United Devices.

<p>
<b>2000 - 2002: Chief Technology Officer, United Devices</b>
<p>
This company developed a platform for Internet-scale
distributed computing and storage,
and marketed this platform in a number of application
areas such as Bioinformatics and Web load testing.
As CTO, I was responsible for the platform architecture,
including its API, its cross-platform client software,
and its back-end server and database.
<p>
<b>
1995 - 1999:  Chief Technology Officer, Tunes.com, Berkeley CA.
</b>
<p>
I architected and implemented a database-driven, Web-based system
for personalized music discovery and marketing.
This system involves a number of technology components:
<ul>
<li>
A system for automated sampling of CDs and encoding
into multiple compressed formats (Real Audio, PAC).
This was used to produce a library of about one million audio samples.
<li>
A relational database of CD information (UPC/track/title/artist etc.)
combining data from several commercial sources.
<li>
A CGI-based Web interface for browsing,
listening to, and rating musical selections.
<li>
Algorithms for obtaining user "music taste profiles"
on the basis of listening patterns and ratings,
and for generating listening suggestions based on
these profiles and expert editorial data.
</ul>
<p>
<b>
1995 - present:  Consultant
</b>
<p>
My consulting contracts have included:
<ul>
<li>
For Virtual University International.
Developed basic technology (Java/Javascript/SQL) for presenting
personalized structured instructional material via the Web.
<li>
For Hotwired.com: prototyped a collaborative-filtering system
for content personalization.
<li>
For Jump! Software Inc.: Developed a web site for sheet music sales,
and an associated aggregation/shipping system,
using Cold Fusion, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access and VB.
</ul>
I also developed and operated rare.com,
a Web-based system for rating-based recommendation
of movies, TV, and other entertainment;
and HORSE, a kiosk-based science museum exhibit that
teaches the principles of radio SETI using interactive audio and animation.
<p>
<b>
1992 - 1995:  Director of Software Architecture,
Sonic Solutions, San Rafael CA.
</b>
<p>
I was the technical leader in developing SonicSystem,
a distributed digital audio editing system based on FDDI,
Macintosh, and proprietary DSP and I/O boards.
I designed and implemented a high-performance filesystem,
a custom transport protocol, and a system for reserving device bandwidth
so that multiple users can share resources without performance conflicts.

<p>
SonicSystem's core technology was reused in MediaNet,
a high-speed network file system for I/O-intensive Macintosh applications,
able to deliver 4 Megabytes per second from a remote disk to an application.
I designed and implemented the entire software data path
(client cache and readahead mechanism, NuBus DMA system, Macintosh OS hooks).

<p>
I was responsible for the system-level software of SonicSystem and MediaNet.
My role included cross-platform software design,
software architecture for Sonic's next generation of audio and video products,
and the design of software interfaces for OEM partners.

<p><b>
1985 - 1992:  Assistant Professor, CS Division, EECS Department,
University of California at Berkeley. 
</b>
<p>

While at Berkeley I taught undergraduate courses in operating systems
and introductory programming, and graduate courses in operating systems,
distributed systems and networks, and multimedia systems.
I advised eight Masters and two Ph.D theses.
<p>
I organized and led several research projects at UC Berkeley, including:

<ul>
<li>
The ACME project produced 1) a network I/O server for digital audio/video
on Sun workstations, 2) a distributed C++ toolkit for this server,
and 3) teleconferencing and A/V editing applications.
I did related projects involving resource reservation and scheduling,
file systems, and basic OS mechanisms for digital audio/video.

<li>
The DASH project developed a new operating system kernel
for the Sparc and Sequent Symmetry architectures.
DASH pioneered new ideas in security, virtual memory, real-time communication,
multiprocessor support, and object-oriented kernel design.

<li>
The AERO project developed a system for fault-tolerant parallel distributed
programming on heterogeneous networks of UNIX workstations.

<li>
The FORMULA and MOOD projects developed concurrent real-time programming
systems for algorithmic computer music, based on Forth and C++ respectively.
</ul>

<h2>Awards</h3>
<p>
1986: IBM Faculty Development grant.
<p>
1987: NSF Presidential Young Investigator award.
