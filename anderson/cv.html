<h2>Employment</h2>
<p>
<b> 2002 - 2022: Research Scientist, Space Sciences Lab, U.C. Berkeley</b>
<p>
I created and led BOINC,
a research project that develops middleware for volunteer computing.
BOINC is used by SETI@home, Climateprediction.net, Einstein@home,
and about 30 other scientific computing projects from universities
and research labs around the world.
I am Principal Investigator or co-PI on four National Science
Foundation grants supporting BOINC.
<p>
I worked on the Stardust@home project led by Andrew Westphal at SSL,
developing the "virtual microscope" technology
enabling volunteers to look for particles of interstellar dust
in microphotographs of an Aerogel collector.

<p>
<b>1997 - 2016: Director, SETI@home, U.C. Berkeley</b>
<p>
SETI@home is a research project
that uses Internet-connected computers to analyze radio-telescope data
in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).
Since its public launch in May 1999,
over 3,000,000 people have contributed 2 million years of computer time.
<p>
As project director, I raised about $2M in funds
from a variety of private and public sources,
hired and managed a team of 6 programmers and system administrators,
handled news media, and managed the web site.
I designed and managed development of the client-
and server-side software, the web site, and the database.
I managed the transition of SETI@home to the BOINC platform.

<p>
<b>2000 - 2002: Chief Technology Officer, United Devices</b>
<p>
This company developed a platform for Internet-scale
distributed computing and storage,
and marketed this platform in a number of application
areas such as Bioinformatics and Web load testing.
As CTO, I was responsible for the platform architecture,
including its API, its cross-platform client software,
and its back-end server and database.
<p>
<b>
1995 - 1999:  Chief Technology Officer, Tunes.com, Berkeley CA.
</b>
<p>
I architected and implemented a database-driven, Web-based system
for personalized music discovery and marketing.
This system involves a number of technology components:
<ul>
<li>
A system for automated sampling of CDs and encoding
into multiple compressed formats (Real Audio, PAC).
This was used to produce a library of about one million audio samples.
<li>
A relational database of CD information (UPC/track/title/artist etc.)
combining data from several commercial sources.
<li>
A Web interface for browsing,
listening to, and rating musical selections.
<li>
Algorithms for obtaining user "music taste profiles"
on the basis of listening patterns and ratings,
and for generating listening suggestions based on
these profiles and expert editorial data.
</ul>
<p>
<b>
1995 - present:  Consultant
</b>
<p>
My consulting contracts have included:
<ul>
<li>
For Virtual University International.
Developed basic technology (Java/Javascript/SQL) for presenting
personalized structured instructional material via the Web.
<li>
For Hotwired.com: prototyped a collaborative-filtering system
for content personalization.
<li>
For Jump! Software Inc.: Developed a web site for sheet music sales,
and an associated aggregation/shipping system,
using Cold Fusion, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access and VB.
</ul>
I also developed and operated rare.com,
a Web-based system for rating-based recommendation
of movies, TV, and other entertainment;
and HORSE, a kiosk-based science museum exhibit that
teaches the principles of radio SETI using interactive audio and animation.
<p>
<b>
1992 - 1995:  Director of Software Architecture,
Sonic Solutions, San Rafael CA.
</b>
<p>
I was the technical leader in developing SonicSystem,
a distributed digital audio editing system based on FDDI,
Macintosh, and proprietary DSP and I/O boards.
I designed and implemented a high-performance filesystem,
a custom transport protocol, and a system for reserving device bandwidth
so that multiple users can share resources without performance conflicts.
SonicSystem's core technology was reused in MediaNet,
a high-speed network file system for I/O-intensive Macintosh applications.
I designed and implemented the entire software data path
(client cache and readahead mechanism, NuBus DMA system, Macintosh OS hooks).
I was responsible for the system-level software of SonicSystem and MediaNet.
My role included cross-platform software design,
software architecture for Sonic's next generation of audio and video products,
and the design of software interfaces for OEM partners.

<p><b>
1985 - 1992:  Assistant Professor, CS Division, EECS Department,
University of California at Berkeley. 
</b>
<p>

I taught undergraduate courses in operating systems
and introductory programming, and graduate courses in operating systems,
distributed systems and networks, and multimedia systems.
I advised eight Masters and two Ph.D theses.
I organized and led several research projects, including:

<ul>
<li>
The ACME project produced 1) a network I/O server for digital audio/video
on Sun workstations, 2) a distributed C++ toolkit for this server,
and 3) teleconferencing and A/V editing applications.
I did related projects involving resource reservation and scheduling,
file systems, and basic OS mechanisms for digital audio/video.

<li>
The DASH project developed a new operating system kernel
for the Sparc and Sequent Symmetry architectures.
DASH pioneered new ideas in security, virtual memory, real-time communication,
multiprocessor support, and object-oriented kernel design.

<li>
The AERO project developed a system for fault-tolerant parallel distributed
programming on heterogeneous networks of UNIX workstations.

<li>
The FORMULA and MOOD projects developed concurrent real-time programming
systems for algorithmic computer music, based on Forth and C++ respectively.
</ul>

<h2>Awards</h3>
<p>
1986: IBM Faculty Development grant.
<p>
1987: NSF Presidential Young Investigator award.


<h2>Patents</h2>
