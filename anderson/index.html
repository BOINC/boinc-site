I received an MA in Mathematics
and Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
From 1985 to 1992 I was on the faculty of the
U.C. Berkeley Computer Science Department.
<p>
My research interests include volunteer computing, distributed systems,
operating systems, multimedia systems, computer graphics,
computer music, music discovery,
human computing, and adaptively personalized web-based education.

<li> <a href=resume.html>CV</a>
<li> <a href=http://continuum-hypothesis.com/pubs.php>Publications and patents</a>
</ul>

Current projects:

<ul>
<li> <a href=https://boinc.berkeley.edu/>BOINC</a>,
a middleware system for volunteer computing (since 2002).
<li> <a href=https://scienceunited.org>Science United</a>,
a framework for BOINC-based volunteer computing (since 2016).
<li> <a href=https://music-match.org>Music Match</a>,
a web-based system that lets classical musicians
discover one another and communicate (since 2021).
<li>
<a href=https://github.com/davidpanderson/Numula/wiki>Numula</a>,
a Python-based system for generating nuanced musical performances (since 2021).
<li> <a href=https://classicalmusicindex.org>Classical Music Index</a>,
an index of classical music meta-data with advanced search capabilities.
</ul>

Past projects:
<ul>
<li> <a href=https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/PANOSETI.html>PanoSETI</a>,
an all-sky telescope that detects extremely
short and faint optical flashes (2021-2022).
<li> I directed
<a href=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu>SETI@home</a>,
a pioneering volunteer computing project (1998-2020).
<li>
<a href=https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/nebula/index.php>Nebula</a>,
SETI@home's back-end data analysis system (2016-2020).
<li> <a href=https://github.com/davidpanderson/bossa/wiki>Bossa</a>,
a system for "distributed thinking".
<li> <a href=https://github.com/davidpanderson/bolt/wiki>Bolt</a>,
a system for adaptive teaching.
<li> In the late 90s I developed Tunes.com,
a web site for music discovery and CD sales.
<li> In the mid-90s I developed RARE (Rating and Recommendation Engine),
    a system for recommending movies to individuals and groups
    based on collaborative filtering.
<li> I received a patent for
<a href=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/88/19/4d/696d23f0c375b6/US5714997.pdf>Virtual Reality Television</a>.
It was never implemented but maybe someday it will be.
<li> In 1993-95 I worked on the Sonic System,
    the first distributed system for digital audio editing;
    it was used for music and movie sound-track production.
<li> In the 80s Ron Kuivila and I developed FORMULA,
    a programming language for computer music.
    FORMULA pioneered the use of separate process to generate
    variations of dynamics, tempo, and articulation.
    FORMULA was used by projects described
    <a href=http://escuta.org/en/projects/installation/the-talking-chair/introduction.html>here</a>

    and
