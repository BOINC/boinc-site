<h2>Computation credit</h2>

<p>
Each project gives you <b>credit</b> for the computations your
computers performs for the project.
These credits are used to generate web-site "leaderboards" showing
individuals, teams, and categories (countries, CPU types, etc.)
ranked by credit.

<p>
BOINC's credit system is based on a unit of computation
called a <b>Cobblestone</b>, defined as
<ul>
<li>1 billion floating-point multiply/adds
<li>1 billion integer multiply/adds
<li>4 billion bytes of traffic to and from main memory
(sequential, half reads and half writes)
</ul>

<p>
In principle, credit should reflect network transfer and disk storage as well
as computation.
But it's hard to verify these activities,
so for now they aren't included.

<p>
Each project maintains two types of credit:
<ul>
<li> <b>Total credit</b>:
The total number of Cobblestones performed.
<li> <b>Recent average credit</b>:
The average number of Cobblestones per second performed recently
("recently" is defined by an exponential function
that decays by a factor of e every week).
</ul>

<p>
Both types of credit are maintained for both users and hosts.
