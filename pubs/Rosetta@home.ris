AB  - Natural molecular machines contain protein components that undergo motion relative to each other. Designing such mechanically constrained nanoscale protein architectures with internal degrees of freedom is an outstanding challenge for computational protein design. Here we explore the de novo construction of protein machinery from designed axle and rotor components with internal cyclic or dihedral symmetry. We find that the axle-rotor systems assemble in vitro and in vivo as designed. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we find that these systems populate conformationally variable relative orientations reflecting the symmetry of the coupled components and the computationally designed interface energy landscape. These mechanical systems with internal degrees of freedom are a step toward the design of genetically encodable nanomachines.

            Steps toward a nanomachine
            
              Protein rotary machines such as ATP synthase contain axle-like and ring-like components and couple biochemical energy to the mechanical work of rotating the components relative to each other. Courbet
              et al
              . have taken a step toward designing such axel-rotor nanomachines. A structural requirement is that interactions between the components must be strong enough to allow assembly but still allow different rotational states to be populated. The authors met this design challenge and computationally designed ring-like protein topologies (rotors) with a range of inner diameters that accommodate designed axle-like binding partners. The systems assemble and populate the different rotational states anticipated by the designs. These rotational energy landscapes provide one of two needed elements for a directional motor. —VV

AB  - Proteins can be designed that bind to specific patches on target proteins to alter their subsequent interactions.
          , 
            We describe a general computational method for designing proteins that bind a surface patch of interest on a target macromolecule. Favorable interactions between disembodied amino acid residues and the target surface are identified and used to anchor de novo designed interfaces. The method was used to design proteins that bind a conserved surface patch on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus. After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model. Such designed binding proteins may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.

              Enzymes tend to direct reactions toward specific products much more selectively than synthetic catalysts. Unfortunately, this selectivity has evolved for cellular purposes and may not promote the sorts of reactions chemists are seeking to enhance (see the Perspective by

            Synthetic enzymes catalyze a carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction with high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity.
          , 
            The Diels-Alder reaction is a cornerstone in organic synthesis, forming two carbon-carbon bonds and up to four new stereogenic centers in one step. No naturally occurring enzymes have been shown to catalyze bimolecular Diels-Alder reactions. We describe the de novo computational design and experimental characterization of enzymes catalyzing a bimolecular Diels-Alder reaction with high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structure matches the design for the most active of the enzymes, and binding site substitutions reprogram the substrate specificity. Designed stereoselective catalysts for carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions should be broadly useful in synthetic chemistry.

              Determination of tertiary protein structures by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) currently relies heavily on side-chain NMR data. The assignment of side-chain atoms is challenging. In addition, proteins larger than 15 kilodaltons (kD) must be deuterated to improve resolution and this eliminates the possibility of measuring long-range interproton distance constraints.

              , published online 4 February) use backbone-only NMR data—chemical shifts, residual dipolar coupling, and backbone amide proton distances—available from highly deuterated proteins to guide conformational searching in the Rosetta structure prediction protocol. Using this new protocol, they were able to generate accurate structures for proteins of up to 25 kD.

            Protein structures can be determined by using the limited nuclear magnetic resonance information obtainable for larger proteins.
          , 
            Conventional protein structure determination from nuclear magnetic resonance data relies heavily on side-chain proton-to-proton distances. The necessary side-chain resonance assignment, however, is labor intensive and prone to error. Here we show that structures can be accurately determined without nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information on the side chains for proteins up to 25 kilodaltons by incorporating backbone chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and amide proton distances into the Rosetta protein structure modeling methodology. These data, which are too sparse for conventional methods, serve only to guide conformational search toward the lowest-energy conformations in the folding landscape; the details of the computed models are determined by the physical chemistry implicit in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. The new method is not hindered by the deuteration required to suppress nuclear relaxation processes for proteins greater than 15 kilodaltons and should enable routine NMR structure determination for larger proteins.

AB  - In a first systematic exploration of phasing with Rosetta de novo models, it is shown that all-atom refinement of coarse-grained models significantly improves both the model quality and performance in molecular replacement with the Phaser software., The prospect of phasing diffraction data sets ‘de novo’ for proteins with previously unseen folds is appealing but largely untested. In a first systematic exploration of phasing with Rosetta de novo models, it is shown that all-atom refinement of coarse-grained models significantly improves both the model quality and performance in molecular replacement with the Phaser software. 15 new cases of diffraction data sets that are unambiguously phased with de novo models are presented. These diffraction data sets represent nine space groups and span a large range of solvent contents (33–79%) and asymmetric unit copy numbers (1–4). No correlation is observed between the ease of phasing and the solvent content or asymmetric unit copy number. Instead, a weak correlation is found with the length of the modeled protein: larger proteins required somewhat less accurate models to give successful molecular replacement. Overall, the results of this survey suggest that de novo models can phase diffraction data for approximately one sixth of proteins with sizes of 100 residues or less. However, for many of these cases, ‘de novo phasing with de novo models’ requires significant investment of computational power, much greater than 103 CPU days per target. Improvements in conformational search methods will be necessary if molecular replacement with de novo models is to become a practical tool for targets without homology to previously solved protein structures.

AB  - Interleaved dimers and higher order symmetric oligomers are ubiquitous in biology but present a challenge to de novo structure prediction methodology: The structure adopted by a monomer can be stabilized largely by interactions with other monomers and hence not the lowest energy state of a single chain. Building on the Rosetta framework, we present a general method to simultaneously model the folding and docking of multiple-chain interleaved homo-oligomers. For more than a third of the cases in a benchmark set of interleaved homo-oligomers, the method generates near-native models of large α-helical bundles, interlocking β sandwiches, and interleaved α/β motifs with an accuracy high enough for molecular replacement based phasing. With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 Å rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta “fold-and-dock” protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with near-atomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.

TI  - Computation of Conformational Coupling in Allosteric Proteins

T2  - PLoS Computational Biology
AB  - In allosteric regulation, an effector molecule binding a protein at one site induces conformational changes, which alter structure and function at a distant active site. Two key challenges in the computational modeling of allostery are the prediction of the structure of one allosteric state starting from the structure of the other, and elucidating the mechanisms underlying the conformational coupling of the effector and active sites. Here we approach these two challenges using the Rosetta high-resolution structure prediction methodology. We find that the method can recapitulate the relaxation of effector-bound forms of single domain allosteric proteins into the corresponding ligand-free states, particularly when sampling is focused on regions known to change conformation most significantly. Analysis of the coupling between contacting pairs of residues in large ensembles of conformations spread throughout the landscape between and around the two allosteric states suggests that the transitions are built up from blocks of tightly coupled interacting sets of residues that are more loosely coupled to one another., A common means of biological regulation is allostery, in which an effector molecule binds to one site on a protein and induces a conformational change which changes activity at a distant active site. Frequently high resolution structures are determined for one state of an allosteric protein but not the other. To probe the allosteric conformational changes in such cases, we describe a computational method for predicting the structure of one allosteric state of a protein starting with knowledge of another. Our method also provides a detailed map of the free energy landscape traversed in an allosteric transition and reveals the coupling between interacting residue pairs that underlies the transition.

AB  - Protein NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to local structure. A robust protocol is described that exploits this relation for de novo protein structure generation, using as input experimental parameters the 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1Hα and 1HN NMR chemical shifts. These shifts are generally available at the early stage of the traditional NMR structure determination process, before the collection and analysis of structural restraints. The chemical shift based structure determination protocol uses an empirically optimized procedure to select protein fragments from the Protein Data Bank, in conjunction with the standard ROSETTA Monte Carlo assembly and relaxation methods. Evaluation of 16 proteins, varying in size from 56 to 129 residues, yielded full-atom models that have 0.7–1.8 Å root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms relative to the experimentally determined x-ray or NMR structures. The strategy also has been successfully applied in a blind manner to nine protein targets with molecular masses up to 15.4 kDa, whose conventional NMR structure determination was conducted in parallel by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. This protocol potentially provides a new direction for high-throughput NMR structure determination.

AB  - The biological behaviors of ribozymes, riboswitches, and numerous other functional RNA molecules are critically dependent on their tertiary folding and their ability to sample multiple functional states. The conformational heterogeneity and partially folded nature of most of these states has rendered their characterization by high-resolution structural approaches difficult or even intractable. Here we introduce a method to rapidly infer the tertiary helical arrangements of large RNA molecules in their native and non-native solution states. Multiplexed hydroxyl radical (·OH) cleavage analysis (MOHCA) enables the high-throughput detection of numerous pairs of contacting residues via random incorporation of radical cleavage agents followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We validated this technology by recapitulating the unfolded and native states of a well studied model RNA, the P4–P6 domain of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, at subhelical resolution. We then applied MOHCA to a recently discovered third state of the P4–P6 RNA that is stabilized by high concentrations of monovalent salt and whose partial order precludes conventional techniques for structure determination. The three-dimensional portrait of a compact, non-native RNA state reveals a well ordered subset of native tertiary contacts, in contrast to the dynamic but otherwise similar molten globule states of proteins. With its applicability to nearly any solution state, we expect MOHCA to be a powerful tool for illuminating the many functional structures of large RNA molecules and RNA/protein complexes.

TI  - Protein–Protein Docking with Backbone Flexibility
AU  - Wang, Chu

T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - Computational protein–protein docking methods currently can create models with atomic accuracy for protein complexes provided that the conformational changes upon association are restricted to the side chains. However, it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking, and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. Here we present a reformulation of the Rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein–protein docking. The new method is based on a “fold-tree” representation of the molecular system, which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid-body degrees of freedom. Problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees. The explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near-native and incorrect models.

AB  - We describe predictions made using the Rosetta structure prediction methodology for both template-based modeling and free modeling categories in the Seventh Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. For the first time, aggressive sampling and all-atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the Rosetta@home distributed computing network. Template-based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. Free modeling methods gave near-atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. These results indicate that refinement with an all-atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions.

TI  - Automated de novo prediction of native-like RNA tertiary structures
AU  - Das, Rhiju
AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - RNA tertiary structure prediction has been based almost entirely on base-pairing constraints derived from phylogenetic covariation analysis. We describe here a complementary approach, inspired by the Rosetta low-resolution protein structure prediction method, that seeks the lowest energy tertiary structure for a given RNA sequence without using evolutionary information. In a benchmark test of 20 RNA sequences with known structure and lengths of ≈30 nt, the new method reproduces better than 90% of Watson–Crick base pairs, comparable with the accuracy of secondary structure prediction methods. In more than half the cases, at least one of the top five models agrees with the native structure to better than 4 Å rmsd over the backbone. Most importantly, the method recapitulates more than one-third of non-Watson–Crick base pairs seen in the native structures. Tandem stacks of “sheared” base pairs, base triplets, and pseudoknots are among the noncanonical features reproduced in the models. In the cases in which none of the top five models were native-like, higher energy conformations similar to the native structures are still sampled frequently but not assigned low energies. These results suggest that modest improvements in the energy function, together with the incorporation of information from phylogenetic covariance, may allow confident and accurate structure prediction for larger and more complex RNA chains.

AB  - We have developed a method that combines the ROSETTA de novo protein folding and refinement protocol with distance constraints derived from homologous structures to build homology models that are frequently more accurate than their templates. We test this method by building complete-chain models for a benchmark set of 22 proteins, each with 1 or 2 candidate templates, for a total of 39 test cases. We use structure-based and sequence-based alignments for each of the test cases. All atoms, including hydrogens, are represented explicitly. The resulting models contain approximately the same number of atomic overlaps as experimentally determined crystal structures and maintain good stereochemistry. The most accurate models can be identified by their energies, and in 22 of 39 cases a model that is more accurate than the template over aligned regions is one of the 10 lowest-energy models.

T2  - Proteins
AB  - To generate structures consistent with both the local and nonlocal interactions responsible for protein stability, 3 and 9 residue fragments of known structures with local sequences similar to the target sequence were assembled into complete tertiary structures using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997; 268:209-225). The scoring function used in the simulated annealing procedure consists of sequence-dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix and beta-strand packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets (Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82-95). For each of 21 small, ab initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately 25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging: highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0 A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8 A. These results suggest that ab initio methods may soon become useful for low-resolution structure prediction for proteins that lack a close homologue of known structure.

AB  - We describe a method for generating moderate to high-resolution protein structures using limited NMR data combined with the ab initio protein structure prediction method Rosetta. Peptide fragments are selected from proteins of known structure based on sequence similarity and consistency with chemical shift and NOE data. Models are built from these fragments by minimizing an energy function that favors hydrophobic burial, strand pairing, and satisfaction of NOE constraints. Models generated using this procedure with approximately 1 NOE constraint per residue are in some cases closer to the corresponding X-ray structures than the published NMR solution structures. The method requires only the sparse constraints available during initial stages of NMR structure determination, and thus holds promise for increasing the speed with which protein solution structures can be determined.

AB  - Rosetta ab initio protein structure predictions in CASP4 were considerably more consistent and more accurate than previous ab initio structure predictions. Large segments were correctly predicted (>50 residues superimposed within an RMSD of 6.5 A) for 16 of the 21 domains under 300 residues for which models were submitted. Models with the global fold largely correct were produced for several targets with new folds, and for several difficult fold recognition targets, the Rosetta models were more accurate than those produced with traditional fold recognition models. These promising results suggest that Rosetta may soon be able to contribute to the interpretation of genome sequence information.

AB  - On two different small proteins, the 36-mer villin headpiece domain (HP-36) and the 65-mer structured region of ribosomal protein (S15), several model predictions from the ab initio approach Rosetta were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations for refinement. After clustering the resulting trajectories into conformational families, the average molecular mechanics--Poisson Boltzmann/surface area (MM-PBSA) free energies and alpha carbon (C(alpha)) RMSDs were then calculated for each family. Those conformational families with the lowest average free energies also contained the best C(alpha) RMSD structures (1.4 A for S15 and HP-36 core) and the lowest average C(alpha) RMSDs (1.8 A for S15, 2.1 A for HP-36 core). For comparison, control simulations starting with the two experimental structures were very stable, each consisting of a single conformational family, with an average C(alpha) RMSD of 1.3 A for S15 and 1.2 A for HP-36 core (1.9 A over all residues). In addition, the average free energies' ranks (Spearman rank, r(s)) correlate well with the average C(alpha) RMSDs (r(s) = 0.77 for HP-36, r(s) = 0.83 for S15). Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the MM--PBSA free energy function provide a potentially powerful tool for the protein structure prediction community in allowing for both high-resolution structural refinement and accurate ranking of model predictions. With all of the information that genomics is now providing, this methodology may allow for advances in going from sequence to structure.

AB  - We present the results of a large-scale testing of the ROSETTA method for ab initio protein structure prediction. Models were generated for two independently generated lists of small proteins (up to 150 amino acid residues), and the results were evaluated using traditional rmsd based measures and a novel measure based on the structure-based comparison of the models to the structures in the PDB using DALI. For 111 of 136 all alpha and alpha/beta proteins 50 to 150 residues in length, the method produced at least one model within 7 A rmsd of the native structure in 1000 attempts. For 60 of these proteins, the closest structure match in the PDB to at least one of the ten most frequently generated conformations was found to be structurally related (four standard deviations above background) to the native protein. These results suggest that ab initio structure prediction approaches may soon be useful for generating low resolution models and identifying distantly related proteins with similar structures and perhaps functions for these classes of proteins on the genome scale.

AB  - This study explores the use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) information and global measures of hydrophobic core formation for improving the Rosetta ab initio protein structure prediction method. The most effective use of the MSA information is achieved by carrying out independent folding simulations for a subset of the homologous sequences in the MSA and then identifying the free energy minima common to all folded sequences via simultaneous clustering of the independent folding runs. Global measures of hydrophobic core formation, using ellipsoidal rather than spherical representations of the hydrophobic core, are found to be useful in removing non-native conformations before cluster analysis. Through this combination of MSA information and global measures of protein core formation, we significantly increase the performance of Rosetta on a challenging test set. Proteins 2001;43:1-11.

AB  - In order adequately to sample conformational space, methods for protein structure prediction make necessary simplifications that also prevent them from being as accurate as desired. Thus, the idea of feeding them, hierarchically, into a more accurate method that samples less effectively was introduced a decade ago but has not met with more than limited success in a few isolated instances. Ideally, the final stages should be able to identify the native state, show a good correlation with native similarity in order to add value to the selection process, and refine the structures even further. In this work, we explore the possibility of using state-of-the-art explicit solvent molecular dynamics and implicit solvent free energy calculations to accomplish all three of those objectives on 12 small, single-domain proteins, four each of alpha, beta and mixed topologies. We find that this approach is very successful in ranking the native and also enhances the structure selection of predictions generated from the Rosetta method.

AU  - Rohl, Carol A.

T2  - Journal of the American Chemical Society
AB  - As genome-sequencing projects rapidly increase the database of protein sequences, the gap between known sequences and known structures continues to grow exponentially, increasing the demand to accelerate structure determination methods. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are an attractive source of experimental restraints for NMR structure determination, particularly rapid, high-throughput methods, because they yield both local and long-range orientational information and can be easily measured and assigned once the backbone resonances of a protein have been assigned. While very extensive RDC data sets have been used to determine the structure of ubiquitin, it is unclear to what extent such methods will generalize to larger proteins with less complete data sets. Here we incorporate experimental RDC restraints into Rosetta, an ab initio structure prediction method, and demonstrate that the combined algorithm provides a general method for de novo determination of a variety of protein folds from RDC data. Backbone structures for multiple proteins up to approximately 125 residues in length and spanning a range of topological complexities are rapidly and reproducibly generated using data sets that are insufficient in isolation to uniquely determine the protein fold de novo, although ambiguities and errors are observed for proteins with symmetry about an axis of the alignment tensor. The models generated are not high-resolution structures completely defined by experimental data but are sufficiently accurate to accelerate traditional high-resolution NMR structure determination and provide structure-based functional insights.

AB  - We recently developed the Rosetta algorithm for ab initio protein structure prediction, which generates protein structures from fragment libraries using simulated annealing. The scoring function in this algorithm favors the assembly of strands into sheets. However, it does not discriminate between different sheet motifs. After generating many structures using Rosetta, we found that the folding algorithm predominantly generates very local structures. We surveyed the distribution of beta-sheet motifs with two edge strands (open sheets) in a large set of non-homologous proteins. We investigated how much of that distribution can be accounted for by rules previously published in the literature, and developed a filter and a scoring method that enables us to improve protein structure prediction for beta-sheet proteins.

AB  - Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction, there has been relatively little connection between experimental protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) of the native structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction. Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high CO structures and an excess of low CO structures, as expected if the computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process. Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction in the CASP4 (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment involved high CO structures likely to fold much more slowly than the lower CO structures for which reasonable predictions were made. This bias against high CO structures can be partially alleviated by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting out the higher CO structures, and eliminating the very low CO structures; this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies may be possible following significant increases in high-performance computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high CO conformations (high CO proteins can take six orders of magnitude longer to fold than low CO proteins). Importantly for such a strategy, simulations performed for high CO structures converge much less strongly than those for low CO structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence can indicate the need for improved sampling of high CO conformations. The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may extend to misfolding: The very low CO structures that accumulate in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.

AB  - We use the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method to produce three-dimensional structure models for all Pfam-A sequence families with average length under 150 residues and no link to any protein of known structure. To estimate the reliability of the predictions, the method was calibrated on 131 proteins of known structure. For approximately 60% of the proteins one of the top five models was correctly predicted for 50 or more residues, and for approximately 35%, the correct SCOP superfamily was identified in a structure-based search of the Protein Data Bank using one of the models. This performance is consistent with results from the fourth critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP4). Correct and incorrect predictions could be partially distinguished using a confidence function based on a combination of simulation convergence, protein length and the similarity of a given structure prediction to known protein structures. While the limited accuracy and reliability of the method precludes definitive conclusions, the Pfam models provide the only tertiary structure information available for the 12% of publicly available sequences represented by these large protein families.

TI  - Evaluation of structural and evolutionary contributions to deleterious mutation prediction
AU  - Saunders, Christopher T.
AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - Methods for automated prediction of deleterious protein mutations have utilized both structural and evolutionary information but the relative contribution of these two factors remains unclear. To address this, we have used a variety of structural and evolutionary features to create simple deleterious mutation models that have been tested on both experimental mutagenesis and human allele data. We find that the most accurate predictions are obtained using a solvent-accessibility term, the C(beta) density, and a score derived from homologous sequences, SIFT. A classification tree using these two features has a cross-validated prediction error of 20.5% on an experimental mutagenesis test set when the prior probability for deleterious and neutral cases is equal, whereas this prediction error is 28.8% and 22.2% using either the C(beta) density or SIFT alone. The improvement imparted by structure increases when fewer homologs are available: when restricted to three homologs the prediction error improves from 26.9% using SIFT alone to 22.4% using SIFT and the C(beta) density, or 24.8% using SIFT and a noisy C(beta) density term approximating the inaccuracy of ab initio structures modeled by the Rosetta method. We conclude that methods for deleterious mutation prediction should include structural information when fewer than five to ten homologs are available, and that ab initio predicted structures may soon be useful in such cases when high-resolution structures are unavailable.

AB  - We describe predictions of the structures of CASP5 targets using Rosetta. The Rosetta fragment insertion protocol was used to generate models for entire target domains without detectable sequence similarity to a protein of known structure and to build long loop insertions (and N-and C-terminal extensions) in cases where a structural template was available. Encouraging results were obtained both for the de novo predictions and for the long loop insertions; we describe here the successes as well as the failures in the context of current efforts to improve the Rosetta method. In particular, de novo predictions failed for large proteins that were incorrectly parsed into domains and for topologically complex (high contact order) proteins with swapping of segments between domains. However, for the remaining targets, at least one of the five submitted models had a long fragment with significant similarity to the native structure. A fully automated version of the CASP5 protocol produced results that were comparable to the human-assisted predictions for most of the targets, suggesting that automated genomic-scale, de novo protein structure prediction may soon be worthwhile. For the three targets where the human-assisted predictions were significantly closer to the native structure, we identify the steps that remain to be automated.

AB  - Robetta is a fully automated protein structure prediction server that uses the Rosetta fragment-insertion method. It combines template-based and de novo structure prediction methods in an attempt to produce high quality models that cover every residue of a submitted sequence. The first step in the procedure is the automatic detection of the locations of domains and selection of the appropriate modeling protocol for each domain. For domains matched to a homolog with an experimentally characterized structure by PSI-BLAST or Pcons2, Robetta uses a new alignment method, called K*Sync, to align the query sequence onto the parent structure. It then models the variable regions by allowing them to explore conformational space with fragments in fashion similar to the de novo protocol, but in the context of the template. When no structural homolog is available, domains are modeled with the Rosetta de novo protocol, which allows the full length of the domain to explore conformational space via fragment-insertion, producing a large decoy ensemble from which the final models are selected. The Robetta server produced quite reasonable predictions for targets in the recent CASP-5 and CAFASP-3 experiments, some of which were at the level of the best human predictions.

TI  - Conserved residue clustering and protein structure prediction
AU  - Schueler-Furman, Ora
AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Proteins
AB  - Protein residues that are critical for structure and function are expected to be conserved throughout evolution. Here, we investigate the extent to which these conserved residues are clustered in three-dimensional protein structures. In 92% of the proteins in a data set of 79 proteins, the most conserved positions in multiple sequence alignments are significantly more clustered than randomly selected sets of positions. The comparison to random subsets is not necessarily appropriate, however, because the signal could be the result of differences in the amino acid composition of sets of conserved residues compared to random subsets (hydrophobic residues tend to be close together in the protein core), or differences in sequence separation of the residues in the different sets. In order to overcome these limits, we compare the degree of clustering of the conserved positions on the native structure and on alternative conformations generated by the de novo structure prediction method Rosetta. For 65% of the 79 proteins, the conserved residues are significantly more clustered in the native structure than in the alternative conformations, indicating that the clustering of conserved residues in protein structures goes beyond that expected purely from sequence locality and composition effects. The differences in the spatial distribution of conserved residues can be utilized in de novo protein structure prediction: We find that for 79% of the proteins, selection of the Rosetta generated conformations with the greatest clustering of the conserved residues significantly enriches the fraction of close-to-native structures.

T2  - Proteins
AB  - Sequence--and structure-based searching strategies have proven useful in the identification of remote homologs and have facilitated both structural and functional predictions of many uncharacterized protein families. We implement these strategies to predict the structure of and to classify a previously uncharacterized cluster of orthologs (COG3019) in the thioredoxin-like fold superfamily. The results of each searching method indicate that thioltransferases are the closest structural family to COG3019. We substantiate this conclusion using the ab initio structure prediction method rosetta, which generates a thioredoxin-like fold similar to that of the glutaredoxin-like thioltransferase (NrdH) for a COG3019 target sequence. This structural model contains the thiol-redox functional motif CYS-X-X-CYS in close proximity to other absolutely conserved COG3019 residues, defining a novel thioredoxin-like active site that potentially binds metal ions. Finally, the rosetta-derived model structure assists us in assembling a global multiple-sequence alignment of COG3019 with two other thioredoxin-like fold families, the thioltransferases and the bacterial arsenate reductases (ArsC).

AB  - We have improved the original Rosetta centroid/backbone decoy set by increasing the number of proteins and frequency of near native models and by building on sidechains and minimizing clashes. The new set consists of 1,400 model structures for 78 different and diverse protein targets and provides a challenging set for the testing and evaluation of scoring functions. We evaluated the extent to which a variety of all-atom energy functions could identify the native and close-to-native structures in the new decoy sets. Of various implicit solvent models, we found that a solvent-accessible surface area-based solvation provided the best enrichment and discrimination of close-to-native decoys. The combination of this solvation treatment with Lennard Jones terms and the original Rosetta energy provided better enrichment and discrimination than any of the individual terms. The results also highlight the differences in accuracy of NMR and X-ray crystal structures: a large energy gap was observed between native and non-native conformations for X-ray structures but not for NMR structures.

AB  - Recently we proposed a novel method of alignment-alignment comparison, COMPASS (the tool for COmparison of Multiple Protein Alignments with Assessment of Statistical Significance). Here we present several examples of the relations between PFAM protein families that were detected by COMPASS and that lead to the predictions of presently unresolved protein structures. We discuss relatively straightforward COMPASS predictions that are new and interesting to us, and that would require a substantial time and effort to justify even for a skilled PSI-BLAST user. All of the presented COMPASS hits are independently confirmed by other methods, including the ab initio structure-prediction method ROSETTA. The tertiary structure predictions made by ROSETTA proved to be useful for improving sequence-derived alignments, because they are based on a reasonable folding of the polypeptide chain rather than on the information from sequence databases. The ability of COMPASS to predict new relations within the PFAM database indicates the high sensitivity of COMPASS searches and substantiates its potential value for the discovery of previously unknown similarities between protein families.

AB  - The strong coupling between secondary and tertiary structure formation in protein folding is neglected in most structure prediction methods. In this work we investigate the extent to which nonlocal interactions in predicted tertiary structures can be used to improve secondary structure prediction. The architecture of a neural network for secondary structure prediction that utilizes multiple sequence alignments was extended to accept low-resolution nonlocal tertiary structure information as an additional input. By using this modified network, together with tertiary structure information from native structures, the Q3-prediction accuracy is increased by 7-10% on average and by up to 35% in individual cases for independent test data. By using tertiary structure information from models generated with the ROSETTA de novo tertiary structure prediction method, the Q3-prediction accuracy is improved by 4-5% on average for small and medium-sized single-domain proteins. Analysis of proteins with particularly large improvements in secondary structure prediction using tertiary structure information provides insight into the feedback from tertiary to secondary structure.

AB  - Angular potentials play an important role in the refinement of protein structures through angle-dependent restraints (e.g., those determined by cross-correlated relaxations, residual dipolar couplings, and hydrogen bonds). Analytic derivatives of such angular potentials with respect to the dihedral angles of proteins would be useful for optimizing such restraints and other types of angular potentials (i.e., such as we are now introducing into protein structure prediction) but have not been described. In this article, analytic derivatives are calculated for four types of angular potentials and integrated with the efficient recursive derivative calculation methods of Gō and coworkers. The formulas are implemented in publicly available software and illustrated by refining a low-resolution protein structure with idealized vector-angle, dipolar-coupling, and hydrogen-bond restraints. The method is now being used routinely to optimize hydrogen-bonding potentials in ROSETTA.

AU  - Meiler, Jens

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
AB  - Experimental structure determination by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy is slow and time-consuming compared with the rate at which new protein sequences are being identified. NMR spectroscopy has the advantage of rapidly providing the structurally relevant information in the form of unassigned chemical shifts (CSs), intensities of NOESY crosspeaks [nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs)], and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), but use of these data are limited by the time and effort needed to assign individual resonances to specific atoms. Here, we develop a method for generating low-resolution protein structures by using unassigned NMR data that relies on the de novo protein structure prediction algorithm, rosetta [Simons, K. T., Kooperberg, C., Huang, E. & Baker, D. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 268, 209-225] and a Monte Carlo procedure that searches for the assignment of resonances to atoms that produces the best fit of the experimental NMR data to a candidate 3D structure. A large ensemble of models is generated from sequence information alone by using rosetta, an optimal assignment is identified for each model, and the models are then ranked based on their fit with the NMR data assuming the identified assignments. The method was tested on nine protein sequences between 56 and 140 amino acids and published CS, NOE, and RDC data. The procedure yielded models with rms deviations between 3 and 6 A, and, in four of the nine cases, the partial assignments obtained by the method could be used to refine the structures to high resolution (0.6-1.8 A) by repeated cycles of structure generation guided by the partial assignments, followed by reassignment using the newly generated models.

T2  - Proteins
AB  - Beta-sheet proteins have been particularly challenging for de novo structure prediction methods, which tend to pair adjacent beta-strands into beta-hairpins and produce overly local topologies. To remedy this problem and facilitate de novo prediction of beta-sheet protein structures, we have developed a neural network that classifies strand-loop-strand motifs by local hairpins and nonlocal diverging turns by using the amino acid sequence as input. The neural network is trained with a representative subset of the Protein Data Bank and achieves a prediction accuracy of 75.9 +/- 4.4% compared to a baseline prediction rate of 59.1%. Hairpins are predicted with an accuracy of 77.3 +/- 6.1%, diverging turns with an accuracy of 73.9 +/- 6.0%. Incorporation of the beta-hairpin/diverging turn classification into the ROSETTA de novo structure prediction method led to higher contact order models and somewhat improved tertiary structure predictions for a test set of 11 all-beta-proteins and 3 alphabeta-proteins. The beta-hairpin/diverging turn classification from amino acid sequences is available online for academic use (Meiler and Kuhn, 2003; www.jens-meiler.de/turnpred.html).

T2  - Proteins
AB  - A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186.

AB  - The Robetta server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org) provides automated tools for protein structure prediction and analysis. For structure prediction, sequences submitted to the server are parsed into putative domains and structural models are generated using either comparative modeling or de novo structure prediction methods. If a confident match to a protein of known structure is found using BLAST, PSI-BLAST, FFAS03 or 3D-Jury, it is used as a template for comparative modeling. If no match is found, structure predictions are made using the de novo Rosetta fragment insertion method. Experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) constraints data can also be submitted with a query sequence for RosettaNMR de novo structure determination. Other current capabilities include the prediction of the effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions using computational interface alanine scanning. The Rosetta protein design and protein-protein docking methodologies will soon be available through the server as well.

T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - pi-pi, Cation-pi, and hydrophobic packing interactions contribute specificity to protein folding and stability to the native state. As a step towards developing improved models of these interactions in proteins, we compare the side-chain packing arrangements in native proteins to those found in compact decoys produced by the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method. We find enrichments in the native distributions for T-shaped and parallel offset arrangements of aromatic residue pairs, in parallel stacked arrangements of cation-aromatic pairs, in parallel stacked pairs involving proline residues, and in parallel offset arrangements for aliphatic residue pairs. We then investigate the extent to which the distinctive features of native packing can be explained using Lennard-Jones and electrostatics models. Finally, we derive orientation-dependent pi-pi, cation-pi and hydrophobic interaction potentials based on the differences between the native and compact decoy distributions and investigate their efficacy for high-resolution protein structure prediction. Surprisingly, the orientation-dependent potential derived from the packing arrangements of aliphatic side-chain pairs distinguishes the native structure from compact decoys better than the orientation-dependent potentials describing pi-pi and cation-pi interactions.

AB  - The Robetta server and revised automatic protocols were used to predict structures for CASP6 targets. Robetta is a publicly available protein structure prediction server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/ that uses the Rosetta de novo and homology modeling structure prediction methods. We incorporated some of the lessons learned in the CASP5 experiment into the server prior to participating in CASP6. We additionally tested new ideas that were amenable to full-automation with an eye toward improving the server. We find that the Robetta server shows the greatest promise for the more challenging targets. The most significant finding from CASP5, that automated protocols can be roughly comparable in ability with the better human-intervention predictors, is repeated here in CASP6.

T2  - Proteins
AB  - Domain boundary prediction is an important step in both experimental and computational protein structure characterization. We have developed two fully automated domain parsing methods: the first, Ginzu, which we have described previously, utilizes information from homologous sequences and structures, while the second, RosettaDOM, which has not been described previously, uses only information in the query sequence. Ginzu iteratively assigns domains by homology to structures and sequence families using successively less confident methods. RosettaDOM uses the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method to build three-dimensional models, and then applies Taylor's structure based domain assignment method to parse the models into domains. Domain boundaries observed repeatedly in the models are predicted to be domain boundaries for the protein. Interestingly, RosettaDOM produced quite good domain predictions for proteins of a size typically considered to be beyond the reach of de novo structure prediction methods. For remote fold recognition targets and new folds, both Ginzu and RosettaDOM produced promising results, and in some cases where one method failed to detect the correct domain boundary, it was correctly identified by the other method. We describe here the successes and failures using both methods, and address the possibility of incorporating both protocols into an improved hybrid method.

AB  - Anthrax toxin is made up of three proteins: the edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF) enzymes, and the multifunctional protective antigen (PA). Proteolytically activated PA heptamerizes, binds the EF/LF enzymes, and forms a pore that allows for EF/LF passage into host cells. Using directed mutagenesis, we identified three LF-PA contact points defined by a specific disulfide crosslink and two pairs of complementary charge-reversal mutations. These contact points were consistent with the lowest energy LF-PA complex found by using Rosetta protein-protein docking. These results illustrate how biochemical and computational methods can be combined to produce reliable models of large complexes. The model shows that EF and LF bind through a highly electrostatic interface, with their flexible N-terminal region positioned at the entrance of the heptameric PA pore and thus poised to initiate translocation in an N- to C-terminal direction.

AB  - We describe the adaptation of the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures. The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between 51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation <4 A from the native structure.

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
AB  - Voltage-gated ion channels control generation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells. Significant progress has been made in understanding structure and function of the voltage-gated ion channels, highlighted by the high-resolution open-state structure of the voltage-gated potassium channel, K(v)1.2. However, because the structure of the closed state is unknown, the gating mechanism remains controversial. We adapted the rosetta membrane method to model the structures of the K(v)1.2 and KvAP channels using homology, de novo, and domain assembly methods and selected the most plausible models using a limited number of experimental constraints. Our model of K(v)1.2 in the open state is very similar in overall topology to the x-ray structure of this channel. Modeling of KvAP in the open state suggests that orientation of the voltage-sensing domain relative to the pore-forming domain is considerably different from the orientation in the K(v)1.2 open state and that the magnitude of the vertical movement of S4 is significantly greater. Structural modeling of closed state of K(v)1.2 suggests gating movement that can be viewed as a sum of two previously suggested mechanisms: translation (2-4 A) plus rotation ( approximately 180 degrees ) of the S4 segment as proposed in the original "sliding helix" or "helical screw" models coupled with a rolling motion of the S1-S3 segments around S4, similar to recent "transporter" models of gating. We propose a unified mechanism of voltage-dependent gating for K(v)1.2 and KvAP in which this major conformational change moves the gating charge across the electric field in an analogous way for both channels.

AB  - We describe the development of a method for assembling structures of multidomain proteins from structures of isolated domains. The method consists of an initial low-resolution search in which the conformational space of the domain linker is explored using the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method, followed by a high-resolution search in which all atoms are treated explicitly and backbone and side chain degrees of freedom are simultaneously optimized. The method recapitulates, often with very high accuracy, the structures of existing multidomain proteins.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the best-studied model organisms, yet the three-dimensional structure and molecular function of many yeast proteins remain unknown. Yeast proteins were parsed into 14,934 domains, and those lacking sequence similarity to proteins of known structure were folded using the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method on the World Community Grid. This structural data was integrated with process, component, and function annotations from the Saccharomyces Genome Database to assign yeast protein domains to SCOP superfamilies using a simple Bayesian approach. We have predicted the structure of 3,338 putative domains and assigned SCOP superfamily annotations to 581 of them. We have also assigned structural annotations to 7,094 predicted domains based on fold recognition and homology modeling methods. The domain predictions and structural information are available in an online database at http://rd.plos.org/10.1371_journal.pbio.0050076_01.

AB  - The creation of enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.

AB  - Targeting the interaction between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a promising therapeutic strategy. We designed inhibitors using two de novo design approaches. Computer-generated scaffolds were either built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) or docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes, and their amino acid sequences were designed to optimize target binding, folding, and stability. Ten designs bound the RBD, with affinities ranging from 100 picomolar to 10 nanomolar, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 24 picomolar and 35 nanomolar. The most potent, with new binding modes, are 56- and 64-residue proteins (IC50 ~ 0.16 nanograms per milliliter). Cryo–electron microscopy structures of these minibinders in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer with all three RBDs bound are nearly identical to the computational models. These hyperstable minibinders provide starting points for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

AB  - This manuscript presents the assessment of the template-based modeling category of the seventh Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7). The accuracy of predicted protein models for 108 target domains was assessed based on a detailed comparison between the experimental and predicted structures. The assessment was performed using numerical measures for backbone and structural alignment accuracy, and by scoring correctly modeled hydrogen bond interactions in the predictions. Based on these criteria, our statistical analysis identified a number of groups whose predictions were on average significantly more accurate. Furthermore, the predictions for six target proteins were evaluated for the accuracy of their modeled cofactor binding sites. We also assessed the ability of predictors to improve over the best available single template structure, which showed that the best groups produced models closer to the target structure than the best single template for a significant number of targets. In addition, we assessed the accuracy of the error estimates (local confidence values) assigned to predictions on a per residue basis. Finally, we discuss some general conclusions about the state of the art of template-based modeling methods and their usefulness for practical applications. Proteins 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - In CASP7, protein structure prediction targets that lacked substantial similarity to a protein in the PDB at the time of assessment were considered to be free modeling targets (FM). We assessed predictions for 14 FM targets as well as four other targets that were deemed to be on the borderline between FM targets and template based modeling targets (TBM/FM). GDT_TS was used as one measure of model quality. Model quality was also assessed by visual inspection. Visual inspection was performed by three independent assessors who were blinded to GDT_TS scores and other quantitative measures of model quality. The best models by visual inspection tended to rank among the top few percent by GDT_TS, but were typically not the highest scoring models. Thus, visual inspection remains an essential component of assessment for FM targets. Overall, group TS020 (Baker) performed best, but success on individual targets was widely distributed among many groups. Among these other groups, TS024 and TS025 (Zhang and Zhang server) performed notably well without exceptionally large computing resources. This should be considered encouraging for future CASPs. There was a sense of progress in template FM relative to CASP6, but we were unable to demonstrate this progress objectively. Proteins 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - How large is the volume of sequence space that is compatible with a given protein structure? Starting from random sequences, low free energy sequences were generated for 108 protein backbone structures by using a Monte Carlo optimization procedure and a free energy function based primarily on Lennard–Jones packing interactions and the Lazaridis–Karplus implicit solvation model. Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51% of the core residues and 27% of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large SH3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for SH3 domain structures. Taken together, these results suggest that the volume of sequence space optimal for a protein structure is surprisingly restricted to a region around the native sequence.

AB  - Based on the crystal structure of the cross-β spine formed by the peptide NNQQNY, we have developed a computational approach for identifying those segments of amyloidogenic proteins that themselves can form amyloid-like fibrils. The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed β-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using rosettadesign, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of ≈80% with a P value of ≈10−12 when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research.

T2  - Protein Science
AB  - Success in high-resolution protein–protein docking requires accurate modeling of side-chain conformations at the interface. Most current methods either leave side chains fixed in the conformations observed in the unbound protein structures or allow the side chains to sample a set of discrete rotamer conformations. Here we describe a rapid and efficient method for sampling off-rotamer side-chain conformations by torsion space minimization during protein–protein docking starting from discrete rotamer libraries supplemented with side-chain conformations taken from the unbound structures, and show that the new method improves side-chain modeling and increases the energetic discrimination between good and bad models. Analysis of the distribution of side-chain interaction energies within and between the two protein partners shows that the new method leads to more native-like distributions of interaction energies and that the neglect of side-chain entropy produces a small but measurable increase in the number of residues whose interaction energy cannot compensate for the entropic cost of side-chain freezing at the interface. The power of the method is highlighted by a number of predictions of unprecedented accuracy in the recent CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) blind test of protein–protein docking methods.

AB  - Protein–protein docking algorithms provide a means to elucidate structural details for presently unknown complexes. Here, we present and evaluate a new method to predict protein–protein complexes from the coordinates of the unbound monomer components. The method employs a low-resolution, rigid-body, Monte Carlo search followed by simultaneous optimization of backbone displacement and side-chain conformations using Monte Carlo minimization. Up to 105 independent simulations are carried out, and the resulting “decoys” are ranked using an energy function dominated by van der Waals interactions, an implicit solvation model, and an orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding potential. Top-ranking decoys are clustered to select the final predictions. Small-perturbation studies reveal the formation of binding funnels in 42 of 54 cases using coordinates derived from the bound complexes and in 32 of 54 cases using independently determined coordinates of one or both monomers. Experimental binding affinities correlate with the calculated score function and explain the predictive success or failure of many targets. Global searches using one or both unbound components predict at least 25% of the native residue–residue contacts in 28 of the 32 cases where binding funnels exist. The results suggest that the method may soon be useful for generating models of biologically important complexes from the structures of the isolated components, but they also highlight the challenges that must be met to achieve consistent and accurate prediction of protein–protein interactions.

T2  - Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics
AB  - RosettaDock uses real-space Monte Carlo minimization (MCM) on both rigid-body and side-chain degrees of freedom to identify the lowest free energy docked arrangement of 2 protein structures. An improved version of the method that uses gradient-based minimization for off-rotamer side-chain optimization and includes information from unbound structures was used to create predictions for Rounds 4 and 5 of CAPRI. First, large numbers of independent MCM trajectories were carried out and the lowest free energy docked configurations identified. Second, new trajectories were started from these lowest energy structures to thoroughly sample the surrounding conformation space, and the lowest energy configurations were submitted as predictions. For all cases in which there were no significant backbone conformational changes, a small number of very low-energy configurations were identified in the first, global search and subsequently found to be close to the center of the basin of attraction in the free energy landscape in the second, local search. Following the release of the experimental coordinates, it was found that the centers of these free energy minima were remarkably close to the native structures in not only the rigid-body orientation but also the detailed conformations of the side-chains. Out of 8 targets, the lowest energy models had interface root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) less than 1.1 Å from the correct structures for 6 targets, and interface RMSDs less than 0.4 Å for 3 targets. The predictions were top submissions to CAPRI for Targets 11, 12, 14, 15, and 19. The close correspondence of the lowest free energy structures found in our searches to the experimental structures suggests that our free energy function is a reasonable representation of the physical chemistry, and that the real space search with full side-chain flexibility to some extent solves the protein–protein docking problem in the absence of significant backbone conformational changes. On the other hand, the approach fails when there are significant backbone conformational changes as the steric complementarity of the 2 proteins cannot be modeled without incorporating backbone flexibility, and this is the major goal of our current work.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 expresses a heterodimeric Fc receptor, gE-gI, on the surfaces of virions and infected cells that binds the Fc region of host immunoglobulin G and is implicated in the cell-to-cell spread of virus. gE-gI binds immunoglobulin G at the basic pH of the cell surface and releases it at the acidic pH of lysosomes, consistent with a role in facilitating the degradation of antiviral antibodies. Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the gE ectodomain (CgE) as the minimal Fc-binding domain and present a 1.78-Å CgE structure. A 5-Å gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independently verified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the CH2-CH3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins. The structure identifies interface histidines that may confer pH-dependent binding and regions of CgE implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus. The ternary organization of the gE-gI/Fc complex is compatible with antibody bipolar bridging, which can interfere with the antiviral immune response.

AB  - Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are ‘selfish’ genetic elements that combine the capability to selectively disrupt specific gene sequences with the ability to rapidly spread from a few individuals to an entire population through homologous recombination repair events. Because of these properties, HEGs are regarded as promising candidates to transfer genetic modifications from engineered laboratory mosquitoes to wild-type populations including Anopheles gambiae the vector of human malaria. Here we show that I-SceI and I-PpoI homing endonucleases cleave their recognition sites with high efficiency in A. gambiae cells and embryos and we demonstrate HEG-induced homologous and non-homologous repair events in a variety of functional assays. We also propose a gene drive system for mosquitoes that is based on our finding that I-PpoI cuts genomic rDNA located on the X chromosome in A. gambiae , which could be used to selectively incapacitate X-carrying spermatozoa thereby imposing a severe male-biased sex ratio.

AB  - Altering the specificity of DNA-cleaving enzymes could be useful in many medical or biotechnological applications, but it is quite a challenge in terms of computational protein design. Ashwell et al. have used computational redesign to alter the target-site specificity of the I-MsoI homing endonuclease, while maintaining wild-type binding affinity. The redesigned enzyme binds and cleaves the new DNA recognition site about 10,000 times more effectively than the wild-type enzyme, with target discrimination comparable to the original endonuclease. These results suggest that computational protein design methods can be used to create novel and highly specific endonucleases for gene therapy and other applications.

AB  - Escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, we developed multivalent protein-based minibinders as potential prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Homotrimers of single minibinders and fusions of three distinct minibinders were designed to geometrically match the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer architecture and were optimized by cell-free expression and found to exhibit virtually no measurable dissociation upon binding. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) showed that these trivalent minibinders engage all three receptor binding domains on a single S trimer. The top candidates neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with IC50 values in the low pM range, resist viral escape, and provide protection in highly vulnerable human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Our integrated workflow promises to accelerate the design of mutationally resilient therapeutics for pandemic preparedness.
One-Sentence Summary We designed, developed, and characterized potent, trivalent miniprotein binders that provide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

AB  - A fundamental test of our current understanding of protein folding is to rationally redesign protein folding pathways. We use a computer-based design strategy to switch the folding pathway of protein G, which normally involves formation of the second, but not the first, β-turn at the rate limiting step in folding. Backbone conformations and amino acid sequences that maximize the interaction density in the first β-hairpin were identified, and two variants containing 11 amino acid replacements were found to be ∼4 kcal mol−1 more stable than wild type protein G. Kinetic studies show that the redesigned proteins fold ∼100× faster than wild type protein and that the first β-turn is formed and the second disrupted at the rate limiting step in folding.

AB  - A major challenge of computational protein design is the creation of novel proteins with arbitrarily chosen three-dimensional structures. Here, we used a general computational strategy that iterates between sequence design and structure prediction to design a 93-residue α/β protein called Top7 with a novel sequence and topology. Top7 was found experimentally to be folded and extremely stable, and the x-ray crystal structure of Top7 is similar (root mean square deviation equals 1.2 angstroms) to the design model. The ability to design a new protein fold makes possible the exploration of the large regions of the protein universe not yet observed in nature.

AB  - We predicted structures for all seven targets in the CAPRI experiment using a new method in development at the time of the challenge. The technique includes a low-resolution rigid body Monte Carlo search followed by high-resolution refinement with side-chain conformational changes and rigid body minimization. Decoys (∼106 per target) were discriminated using a scoring function including van der Waals and solvation interactions, hydrogen bonding, residue–residue pair statistics, and rotamer probabilities. Decoys were ranked, clustered, manually inspected, and selected. The top ranked model for target 6 predicted the experimental structure to 1.5 Å RMSD and included 48 of 65 correct residue–residue contacts. Target 7 was predicted at 5.3 Å RMSD with 22 of 37 correct residue–residue contacts using a homology model from a known complex structure. Using a preliminary version of the protocol in round 1, target 1 was predicted within 8.8 Å although few contacts were correct. For targets 2 and 3, the interface locations and a small fraction of the contacts were correctly identified. Proteins 2003;52:118–122. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - CAPRI Rounds 3, 4, and 5 are the first public test of the published RosettaDock algorithm. The targets cover a wide range of sizes and shapes. For most targets, published biological information indicated the region of the binding site on at least one docking partner. The RosettaDock algorithm produced high accuracy predictions for three targets, medium-accuracy predictions for two targets, and an acceptable prediction for one target. RosettaDock predicted all five targets with less than 450 residues to high or medium accuracy, but it predicted only one of seven targets with above 450 residues to acceptable accuracy. RosettaDock's high-accuracy predictions for small to moderately large targets reveal the predictive power and fidelity of the algorithm, especially the high-resolution refinement and scoring protocol. In addition, RosettaDock can predict complexes from at least one homology-modeled docking partner with comparable accuracy to unbound cases of similar size. Larger targets present a more intensive sampling problem, and some large targets present repulsive barriers to entering the binding site. Ongoing improvements to RosettaDock's low-resolution search may alleviate this problem. This first public test suggests that RosettaDock can be useful in a significant range of applications in biochemistry and cell biology. Proteins 2005;60:181–186. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The current status of docking procedures for predicting protein–protein interactions starting from their three-dimensional (3D) structure is reassessed by evaluating blind predictions, performed during 2003–2004 as part of Rounds 3–5 of the community-wide experiment on Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions (CAPRI). Ten newly determined structures of protein–protein complexes were used as targets for these rounds. They comprised 2 enzyme–inhibitor complexes, 2 antigen–antibody complexes, 2 complexes involved in cellular signaling, 2 homo-oligomers, and a complex between 2 components of the bacterial cellulosome. For most targets, the predictors were given the experimental structures of 1 unbound and 1 bound component, with the latter in a random orientation. For some, the structure of the free component was derived from that of a related protein, requiring the use of homology modeling. In some of the targets, significant differences in conformation were displayed between the bound and unbound components, representing a major challenge for the docking procedures. For 1 target, predictions could not go to completion. In total, 1866 predictions submitted by 30 groups were evaluated. Over one-third of these groups applied completely novel docking algorithms and scoring functions, with several of them specifically addressing the challenge of dealing with side-chain and backbone flexibility. The quality of the predicted interactions was evaluated by comparison to the experimental structures of the targets, made available for the evaluation, using the well-agreed-upon criteria used previously. Twenty-four groups, which for the first time included an automatic Web server, produced predictions ranking from acceptable to highly accurate for all targets, including those where the structures of the bound and unbound forms differed substantially. These results and a brief survey of the methods used by participants of CAPRI Rounds 3–5 suggest that genuine progress in the performance of docking methods is being achieved, with CAPRI acting as the catalyst.

AB  - We present the assessment of CASP5 predictions in the new fold category. For coordinate predictions, we considered five targets with new folds and eight lying on the fold recognition borderline. We performed detailed visual and numerical comparisons between predicted and experimental structures to assess prediction accuracy. The two procedures largely agreed, but the visual inspection identified instances where metrics, such as GDT_TS, ranked what we considered incorrect predictions highly. We found the quality of the best predictions to be very good: for nearly every target at least one group predicted a structure close to the correct one. However, selection of the best of five models is still problematic. The group of David Baker once again proved to be best overall, with many individual highlights. However, high quality and consistency were also seen from others, suggesting that the community is moving toward general procedures to predict accurate structures for proteins showing no resemblance to anything seen before. Predictions for secondary structure showed at best limited progress since CASP4. The number of targets is probably too small to spot differences in performance between methods, suggesting that such predictions might be better evaluated with schemes involving more proteins. For contact predictions, accuracies are still low, although there were several instances of accurate and useful contacts predicted de novo, and new approaches hint at future progress.

AB  - This paper details the assessment process and evaluation results for the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7) domain prediction category. Domain predictions were assessed using the Normalized Domain Overlap score introduced in CASP6 and the accuracy of prediction of domain break points. The results of the analysis clearly demonstrate that the best methods are able to make consistently reliable predictions when the target has a structural template, although they are less good when the domain break occurs in a region not covered by a template. The conditions of the experiment meant that it was impossible to draw any conclusions about domain prediction for free modeling targets and it was also difficult to draw many distinctions between the best groups. Two thirds of the targets submitted were single domains and hence regarded as easy to predict. Even those targets defined as having multiple domains always had at least one domain with a similar template structure. Proteins 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We describe CASP11 de novo blind structure predictions made using the Rosetta structure prediction methodology with both automatic and human assisted protocols. Model accuracy was generally improved using coevolution derived residue–residue contact information as restraints during Rosetta conformational sampling and refinement, particularly when the number of sequences in the family was more than three times the length of the protein. The highlight was the human assisted prediction of T0806, a large and topologically complex target with no homologs of known structure, which had unprecedented accuracy—<3.0 Å root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the crystal structure over 223 residues. For this target, we increased the amount of conformational sampling over our fully automated method by employing an iterative hybridization protocol. Our results clearly demonstrate, in a blind prediction scenario, that coevolution derived contacts can considerably increase the accuracy of template-free structure modeling.

T2  - Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics
AB  - Water-mediated hydrogen bonds play critical roles at protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interfaces, and the interactions formed by discrete water molecules cannot be captured using continuum solvent models. We describe a simple model for the energetics of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and show that, together with knowledge of the positions of buried water molecules observed in X-ray crystal structures, the model improves the prediction of free-energy changes upon mutation at protein–protein interfaces, and the recovery of native amino acid sequences in protein interface design calculations. We then describe a “solvated rotamer” approach to efficiently predict the positions of water molecules, at protein–protein interfaces and in monomeric proteins, that is compatible with widely used rotamer-based side-chain packing and protein design algorithms. Finally, we examine the extent to which the predicted water molecules can be used to improve prediction of amino acid identities and protein–protein interface stability, and discuss avenues for overcoming current limitations of the approach.

T2  - Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics
AB  - The prediction of changes in protein stability and structure resulting from single amino acid substitutions is both a fundamental test of macromolecular modeling methodology and an important current problem as high throughput sequencing reveals sequence polymorphisms at an increasing rate. In principle, given the structure of a wild-type protein and a point mutation whose effects are to be predicted, an accurate method should recapitulate both the structural changes and the change in the folding-free energy. Here, we explore the performance of protocols which sample an increasing diversity of conformations. We find that surprisingly similar performances in predicting changes in stability are achieved using protocols that involve very different amounts of conformational sampling, provided that the resolution of the force field is matched to the resolution of the sampling method. Methods involving backbone sampling can in some cases closely recapitulate the structural changes accompanying mutations but not surprisingly tend to do more harm than good in cases where structural changes are negligible. Analysis of the outliers in the stability change calculations suggests areas needing particular improvement; these include the balance between desolvation and the formation of favorable buried polar interactions, and unfolded state modeling.

AB  - Naturally occurring homooligomeric protein complexes exhibit striking internal symmetry. The evolutionary origins of this symmetry have been the subject of considerable speculation; proposals for the advantages associated with symmetry include greater folding efficiency, reduced aggregation, amenability to allosteric regulation, and greater adaptability. An alternative possibility stems from the idea that to contribute to fitness, and hence be subject to evolutionary optimization, a complex must be significantly populated, which implies that the interaction energy between monomers in the ancestors of modern-day complexes must have been sufficient to at least partially overcome the entropic cost of association. Here, we investigate the effects of this bias toward very-low-energy complexes on the distribution of symmetry in primordial homooligomers modeled as randomly interacting pairs of monomers. We demonstrate quantitatively that a bias toward very-low-energy complexes can result in the emergence of symmetry from random ensembles in which the overall frequency of symmetric complexes is vanishingly small. This result is corroborated by using explicit protein–protein docking calculations to generate ensembles of randomly docked complexes: the fraction of these that are symmetric increases from 0.02% in the overall population to >50% in very low energy subpopulations.

AB  - Repeat proteins have considerable potential for use as modular binding reagents or biomaterials in biomedical and nanotechnology applications. Here we describe a general computational method for building idealized repeats that integrates available family sequences and structural information with Rosetta de novo protein design calculations. Idealized designs from six different repeat families were generated and experimentally characterized; 80% of the proteins were expressed and soluble and more than 40% were folded and monomeric with high thermal stability. Crystal structures determined for members of three families are within 1Å root-mean-square deviation to the design models. The method provides a general approach for fast and reliable generation of stable modular repeat protein scaffolds.

AB  - A previously developed computer program for protein design, RosettaDesign, was used to predict low free energy sequences for nine naturally occurring protein backbones. RosettaDesign had no knowledge of the naturally occurring sequences and on average 65% of the residues in the designed sequences differ from wild-type. Synthetic genes for ten completely redesigned proteins were generated, and the proteins were expressed, purified, and then characterized using circular dichroism, chemical and temperature denaturation and NMR experiments. Although high-resolution structures have not yet been determined, eight of these proteins appear to be folded and their circular dichroism spectra are similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Six of the proteins have stabilities equal to or up to 7kcal/mol greater than their wild-type counterparts, and four of the proteins have NMR spectra consistent with a well-packed, rigid structure. These encouraging results indicate that the computational protein design methods can, with significant reliability, identify amino acid sequences compatible with a target protein backbone.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins play many essential roles in the regulation of gene expression in the cell. Despite the significant increase in the number of structures for RNA–protein complexes in the last few years, the molecular basis of specificity remains unclear even for the best-studied protein families. We have developed a distance and orientation-dependent hydrogen-bonding potential based on the statistical analysis of hydrogen-bonding geometries that are observed in high-resolution crystal structures of protein–DNA and protein–RNA complexes. We observe very strong geometrical preferences that reflect significant energetic constraints on the relative placement of hydrogen-bonding atom pairs at protein–nucleic acid interfaces. A scoring function based on the hydrogen-bonding potential discriminates native protein–RNA structures from incorrectly docked decoys with remarkable predictive power. By incorporating the new hydrogen-bonding potential into a physical model of protein–RNA interfaces with full atom representation, we were able to recover native amino acids at protein–RNA interfaces.

AB  - We report crystal structures of a negatively selected T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes two I-Au-restricted myelin basic protein peptides and one of its peptide/major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligands. Unusual complementarity-determining region (CDR) structural features revealed by our analyses identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the highly variable CDR3 regions define ligand specificity. In addition to the pMHC contact residues contributed by CDR3, the CDR3 residues buried deep within the Vα/Vβ interface exert indirect effects on recognition by influencing the Vα/Vβ interdomain angle. This phenomenon represents an additional mechanism for increasing the potential diversity of the TCR repertoire. Both the direct and indirect effects exerted by CDR residues can impact global TCR/MHC docking. Analysis of the available TCR structures in light of these results highlights the significance of the Vα/Vβ interdomain angle in determining specificity and indicates that TCR/pMHC interface features do not distinguish autoimmune from non-autoimmune class II-restricted TCRs.

AB  - Production of fine chemicals from heterologous pathways in microbial hosts is frequently hindered by insufficient knowledge of the native metabolic pathway and its cognate enzymes; often the pathway is unresolved, and the enzymes lack detailed characterization. An alternative paradigm to using native pathways is de novo pathway design using well-characterized, substrate-promiscuous enzymes. We demonstrate this concept using P450BM3 from Bacillus megaterium. Using a computer model, we illustrate how key P450BM3 active site mutations enable binding of the non-native substrate amorphadiene. Incorporating these mutations into P450BM3 enabled the selective oxidation of amorphadiene artemisinic-11S,12-epoxide, at titers of 250 mg L−1 in E. coli. We also demonstrate high-yielding, selective transformations to dihydroartemisinic acid, the immediate precursor to the high-value antimalarial drug artemisinin.

AU  - Havranek, James J.

T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - Protein–DNA interactions are crucial for many biological processes. Attempts to model these interactions have generally taken the form of amino acid–base recognition codes or purely sequence-based profile methods, which depend on the availability of extensive sequence and structural information for specific structural families, neglect side-chain conformational variability, and lack generality beyond the structural family used to train the model. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in rotamer-based protein design and the large number of structurally characterized protein–DNA complexes to develop and parameterize a simple physical model for protein–DNA interactions. The model shows considerable promise for redesigning amino acids at protein–DNA interfaces, as design calculations recover the amino acid residue identities and conformations at these interfaces with accuracies comparable to sequence recovery in globular proteins. The model shows promise also for predicting DNA-binding specificity for fixed protein sequences: native DNA sequences are selected correctly from pools of competing DNA substrates; however, incorporation of backbone movement will likely be required to improve performance in homology modeling applications. Interestingly, optimization of zinc finger protein amino acid sequences for high-affinity binding to specific DNA sequences results in proteins with little or no predicted specificity, suggesting that naturally occurring DNA-binding proteins are optimized for specificity rather than affinity. When combined with algorithms that optimize specificity directly, the simple computational model developed here should be useful for the engineering of proteins with novel DNA-binding specificities.

AB  - Efforts in structural biology have targeted the systematic determination of all protein structures through experimental determination or modeling. In recent years, 3-D electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) has assumed an increasingly important role in determining the structures of these large macromolecular assemblies to intermediate resolutions (6–10 Å). While these structures provide a snapshot of the assembly and its components in well-defined functional states, the resolution limits the ability to build accurate structural models. In contrast, sequence-based modeling techniques are capable of producing relatively robust structural models for isolated proteins or domains. In this work, we developed and applied a hybrid modeling approach, utilizing cryoEM density and ab initio modeling to produce a structural model for the core domain of a herpesvirus structural protein, VP26. Specifically, this method, first tested on simulated data, utilizes the cryoEM density map as a geometrical constraint in identifying the most native-like models from a gallery of models generated by ab initio modeling. The resulting model for the core domain of VP26, based on the 8.5-Å resolution herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) capsid cryoEM structure and mutational data, exhibited a novel fold. Additionally, the core domain of VP26 appeared to have a complementary interface to the known upper-domain structure of VP5, its cognate binding partner. While this new model provides for a better understanding of the assembly and interactions of VP26 in HSV-1, the approach itself may have broader applications in modeling the components of large macromolecular assemblies.

AB  - Conventional NMR structure determination requires nearly complete assignment of the cross peaks of a refined NOESY peak list. Depending on the size of the protein and quality of the spectral data, this can be a time-consuming manual process requiring several rounds of peak list refinement and structure determination. Programs such as Aria, CYANA, and AutoStructure can generate models using unassigned NOESY data but are very sensitive to the quality of the input peak lists and can converge to inaccurate structures if the signal-to-noise of the peak lists is low. Here, we show that models with high accuracy and reliability can be produced by combining the strengths of the high-resolution structure prediction program Rosetta with global measures of the agreement between structure models and experimental data. A first round of models generated using CS-Rosetta (Rosetta supplemented with backbone chemical shift information) are filtered on the basis of their goodness-of-fit with unassigned NOESY peak lists using the DP-score, and the best fitting models are subjected to high resolution refinement with the Rosetta rebuild-and-refine protocol. This hybrid approach uses both local backbone chemical shift and the unassigned NOESY data to direct Rosetta trajectories toward the native structure and produces more accurate models than AutoStructure/CYANA or CS-Rosetta alone, particularly when using raw unedited NOESY peak lists. We also show that when accurate manually refined NOESY peak lists are available, Rosetta refinement can consistently increase the accuracy of models generated using CYANA and AutoStructure.

AB  - The computational design of transmembrane proteins with more than one membrane-spanning region remains a major challenge. We report the design of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the designed dimer and tetramer—a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane helices—are very close to the design models. Our results pave the way for the design of multispan membrane proteins with new functions.

AB  - Naturally occurring, pharmacologically active peptides constrained with covalent crosslinks generally have shapes that have evolved to fit precisely into binding pockets on their targets. Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18–47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and/or N–C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.

AB  - The self-assembly of proteins into highly ordered nanoscale architectures is a hallmark of biological systems. The sophisticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models. The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two-component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications.

AB  - Nature provides many examples of self- and co-assembling protein-based molecular machines, including icosahedral protein cages that serve as scaffolds, enzymes, and compartments for essential biochemical reactions and icosahedral virus capsids, which encapsidate and protect viral genomes and mediate entry into host cells. Inspired by these natural materials, we report the computational design and experimental characterization of co-assembling, two-component, 120-subunit icosahedral protein nanostructures with molecular weights (1.8 to 2.8 megadaltons) and dimensions (24 to 40 nanometers in diameter) comparable to those of small viral capsids. Electron microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering, and x-ray crystallography show that 10 designs spanning three distinct icosahedral architectures form materials closely matching the design models. In vitro assembly of icosahedral complexes from independently purified components occurs rapidly, at rates comparable to those of viral capsids, and enables controlled packaging of molecular cargo through charge complementarity. The ability to design megadalton-scale materials with atomic-level accuracy and controllable assembly opens the door to a new generation of genetically programmable protein-based molecular machines.

AB  - One of the key challenges in computational biology is prediction of three-dimensional protein structures from amino-acid sequences. For most proteins, the “native state” lies at the bottom of a free-energy landscape. Protein structure prediction involves varying the degrees of freedom of the protein in a constrained manner until it approaches its native state. In the Rosetta protein structure prediction protocols, a large number of independent folding trajectories are simulated, and several lowest-energy results are likely to be close to the native state. The availability of hundred-teraflop, and shortly, petaflop, computing resources is revolutionizing the approaches available for protein structure prediction. Here, we discuss issues involved in utilizing such machines efficiently with the Rosetta code, including an overview of recent results of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction 7 (CASP7) in which the computationally demanding structure-refinement process was run on 16 racks of the IBM Blue Gene/L™ system at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. We highlight recent advances in high-performance computing and discuss future development paths that make use of the next-generation petascale (>1012 floating-point operations per second) machines.

AB  - Advances in our understanding of macromolecular structure come from experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, and also computational analysis of the growing number of atomic models obtained from such experiments. The later analyses have made it possible to develop powerful tools for structure prediction and optimization in the absence of experimental data. In recent years, a synergy between these computational methods for crystallographic structure determination and structure prediction and optimization has begun to be exploited. We review some of the advances in the algorithms used for crystallographic structure determination in the Phenix and Crystallography & NMR System software packages and describe how methods from ab initio structure prediction and refinement in Rosetta have been applied to challenging crystallographic problems. The prospects for future improvement of these methods are discussed.

AB  - Altering the specificity of an enzyme requires precise positioning of side-chain functional groups that interact with the modified groups of the new substrate. This requires not only sequence changes that introduce the new functional groups but also sequence changes that remodel the structure of the protein backbone so that the functional groups are properly positioned. We describe a computational design method for introducing specific enzyme–substrate interactions by directed remodeling of loops near the active site. Benchmark tests on 8 native protein–ligand complexes show that the method can recover native loop lengths and, often, native loop conformations. We then use the method to redesign a critical loop in human guanine deaminase such that a key side-chain interaction is made with the substrate ammelide. The redesigned enzyme is 100-fold more active on ammelide and 2.5e4-fold less active on guanine than wild-type enzyme: The net change in specificity is 2.5e6-fold. The structure of the designed protein was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis: The remodeled loop adopts a conformation that is within 1-Å Cα RMSD of the computational model.

AB  - What conformations do protein molecules populate in solution? Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while NMR describes structure in solution but using less data. NMR structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all <2.5 Å CαRMSD from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more NMR-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or NMR structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function.

AB  - Hydrogen bonding is a key contributor to the specificity of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in biological systems. Here, we develop an orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding potential based on the geometric characteristics of hydrogen bonds in high-resolution protein crystal structures, and evaluate it using four tests related to the prediction and design of protein structures and protein–protein complexes. The new potential is superior to the widely used Coulomb model of hydrogen bonding in prediction of the sequences of proteins and protein–protein interfaces from their structures, and improves discrimination of correctly docked protein–protein complexes from large sets of alternative structures.

AB  - The biological functions of DNA-binding proteins often require that they interact with their targets with high affinity and/or high specificity. Here, we describe a computational method that estimates the extent of optimization for affinity and specificity of amino acids at a protein–DNA interface based on the crystal structure of the complex, by modeling the changes in binding-free energy associated with all individual amino acid and base substitutions at the interface. The extent to which residues are predicted to be optimal for specificity versus affinity varies within a given protein–DNA interface and between different complexes, and in many cases recapitulates previous experimental observations. The approach provides a complement to traditional methods of mutational analysis, and should be useful for rapidly formulating hypotheses about the roles of amino acid residues in protein–DNA interfaces.

AB  - Many naturally occurring protein systems function primarily as symmetric assemblies. Prediction of the quaternary structure of these assemblies is an important biological problem. This article describes automated tools we have developed for predicting the structures of symmetric protein assemblies in the Robetta structure prediction server. We assess the performance of this pipeline on a set of targets from the recent CASP12/CAPRI blind quaternary structure prediction experiment. Our approach successfully predicted 5 of 7 symmetric assemblies in this challenge, and was assessed as the best participating server group, and 1 of only 2 groups (human or server) with 2 predictions judged as high quality by the assessors. We also assess the method on a broader set of 22 natively symmetric CASP12 targets, where we show that oligomeric modeling can improve the accuracy of monomeric structure determination, particularly in highly intertwined oligomers.

AB  - Many scientific disciplines rely on computational methods for data analysis, model generation, and prediction. Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community. The practices described here are independent of subject area and can be readily adopted by other software development communities.

AB  - It is difficult to properly validate algorithms that dock a small molecule ligand into its protein receptor using data from the public domain: the predictions are not blind because the correct binding mode is already known, and public test cases may not be representative of compounds of interest such as drug leads. Here, we use private data from a real drug discovery program to carry out a blind evaluation of the RosettaLigand docking methodology and find that its performance is on average comparable with that of the best commercially available current small molecule docking programs. The strength of RosettaLigand is the use of the Rosetta sampling methodology to simultaneously optimize protein sidechain, protein backbone and ligand degrees of freedom; the extensive benchmark test described here identifies shortcomings in other aspects of the protocol and suggests clear routes to improving the method.

AB  - The binding interface of calmodulin and a calmodulin binding peptide were reengineered by computationally designing complementary bumps and holes. This redesign led to the development of sensitive and specific pairs of mutant proteins used to sense Ca2+ in a second generation of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (cameleons). These cameleons are no longer perturbed by large excesses of native calmodulin, and they display Ca2+ sensitivities tuned over a 100-fold range (0.6–160 μM). Incorporation of circularly permuted Venus in place of Citrine results in a 3- to 5-fold increase in the dynamic range. These redesigned cameleons show significant improvements over previous versions in the ability to monitor Ca2+ in the cytoplasm as well as distinct subcellular localizations, such as the plasma membrane of neurons and the mitochondria.

AB  - Here we present the evaluation results of the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP6) contact prediction category. Contact prediction was assessed with standard measures well known in the field and the performance of specialist groups was evaluated alongside groups that submitted models with 3D coordinates. The evaluation was mainly focused on long range contact predictions for the set of new fold targets, although we analyzed predictions for all targets. Three groups with similar levels of accuracy and coverage performed a little better than the others. Comparisons of the predictions of the three best methods with those of CASP5/CAFASP3 suggested some improvement, although there were not enough targets in the comparisons to make this statistically significant.

T2  - Journal of the American Chemical Society
AB  - A series of enzymes for Kemp elimination of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole has been recently designed and tested. In conjunction with the design process, extensive computational analyses were carried out to evaluate the potential performance of four of the designs, as presented here. The enzyme-catalyzed reactions were modeled using mixed quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations in the context of Monte Carlo (MC) statistical mechanics simulations. Free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations were used to characterize the free-energy surfaces for the catalyzed reactions as well as for reference processes in water. The simulations yielded detailed information about the catalytic mechanisms, activation barriers, and structural evolution of the active sites over the course of the reactions. The catalytic mechanism for the designed enzymes KE07, KE10(V131N), and KE15 was found to be concerted with proton transfer, generally more advanced in the transition state than breaking of the isoxazolyl N−O bond. On the basis of the free-energy results, all three enzymes were anticipated to be active. Ideas for further improvement of the enzyme designs also emerged. On the technical side, the synergy of parallel QM/MM and experimental efforts in the design of artificial enzymes is well illustrated.

TI  - Characterization of the Folding Energy Landscapes of Computer Generated Proteins Suggests High Folding Free Energy Barriers and Cooperativity may be Consequences of Natural Selection
AU  - Scalley-Kim, Michelle
AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - To determine the extent to which protein folding rates and free energy landscapes have been shaped by natural selection, we have examined the folding kinetics of five proteins generated using computational design methods and, hence, never exposed to natural selection. Four of these proteins are complete computer-generated redesigns of naturally occurring structures and the fifth protein, called Top7, has a computer-generated fold not yet observed in nature. We find that three of the four redesigned proteins fold much faster than their naturally occurring counterparts. While natural selection thus does not appear to operate on protein folding rates, the majority of the designed proteins unfold considerably faster than their naturally occurring counterparts, suggesting possible selection for a high free energy barrier to unfolding. In contrast to almost all naturally occurring proteins of less than 100 residues but consistent with simple computational models, the folding energy landscape for Top7 appears to be quite complex, suggesting the smooth energy landscapes and highly cooperative folding transitions observed for small naturally occurring proteins may also reflect the workings of natural selection.

AB  - Hydrogen bonding is a key contributor to the exquisite specificity of the interactions within and between biological macromolecules, and hence accurate modeling of such interactions requires an accurate description of hydrogen bonding energetics. Here we investigate the orientation and distance dependence of hydrogen bonding energetics by combining two quite disparate but complementary approaches: quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations and protein structural analysis. We find a remarkable agreement between the energy landscapes obtained from the electronic structure calculations and the distributions of hydrogen bond geometries observed in protein structures. In contrast, molecular mechanics force fields commonly used for biomolecular simulations do not consistently exhibit close correspondence to either quantum mechanical calculations or experimentally observed hydrogen bonding geometries. These results suggest a route to improved energy functions for biological macromolecules that combines the generality of quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations with the accurate context dependence implicit in protein structural analysis.

AB  - Protein tyrosine kinases are critical cell signaling enzymes. These enzymes have a highly conserved Arg residue in their catalytic loop which is present two residues or four residues downstream from an absolutely conserved Asp catalytic base. Prior studies on protein tyrosine kinases Csk and Src revealed the potential for chemical rescue of catalytically deficient mutant kinases (Arg to Ala mutations) by small diamino compounds, particularly imidazole; however, the potency and efficiency of rescue was greater for Src. This current study further examines the structural and kinetic basis of rescue for mutant Src as compared to mutant Abl tyrosine kinase. An X-ray crystal structure of R388A Src revealed the surprising finding that a histidine residue of the N-terminus of a symmetry-related kinase inserts into the active site of the adjacent Src and mimics the hydrogen-bonding pattern seen in wild-type protein tyrosine kinases. Abl R367A shows potent and efficient rescue more comparable to Src, even though its catalytic loop is more like that of Csk. Various enzyme redesigns of the active sites indicate that the degree and specificity of rescue are somewhat flexible, but the overall properties of the enzymes and rescue agents play an overarching role. The newly discovered rescue agent 2-aminoimidazole is about as efficient as imidazole in rescuing R/A Src and Abl. Rate vs pH studies with these imidazole analogues suggest that the protonated imidazolium is the preferred form for chemical rescue, consistent with structural models. The efficient rescue seen with mutant Abl points to the potential of this approach to be used effectively to analyze Abl phosphorylation pathways in cells.

AB  - Homing endonucleases (HEs) cleave long (∼20 bp) DNA target sites with high site specificity to catalyze the lateral transfer of parasitic DNA elements. In order to determine whether comprehensive computational design could be used as a general strategy to engineer new HE target site specificities, we used RosettaDesign (RD) to generate 3200 different variants of the mCreI LAGLIDADG HE towards 16 different base pair positions in the 22 bp mCreI target site. Experimental verification of a range of these designs demonstrated that over 2/3 (24 of 35 designs, 69%) had the intended new site specificity, and that 14 of the 15 attempted specificity shifts (93%) were achieved. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using structure-based computational design to engineer HE variants with novel target site specificities to facilitate genome engineering.

AB  - Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with l-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of l- and d-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions are key components of all signal transduction processes, so methods to alter these interactions promise to become important tools in dissecting function of connectivities in these networks. We have developed a fast computational approach for the prediction of energetically important amino acid residues in protein-protein interfaces (available at http://robetta.bakerlab.org/alaninescan), which we, following Peter Kollman, have termed "computational alanine scanning." The input consists of a three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex; output is a list of "hot spots," or amino acid side chains that are predicted to significantly destabilize the interface when mutated to alanine, analogous to the results of experimental alanine-scanning mutagenesis. 79% of hot spots and 68% of neutral residues were correctly predicted in a test of 233 mutations in 19 protein-protein complexes. A single interface can be analyzed in minutes. The computational methodology has been validated by the successful design of protein interfaces with new specificity and activity, and has yielded new insights into the mechanisms of receptor specificity and promiscuity in biological systems.

T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - The redesign of protein−protein interactions is a stringent test of our understanding of molecular recognition and specificity. Previously we engineered a modest specificity switch into the colicin E7 DNase−Im7 immunity protein complex by identifying mutations that are disruptive in the native complex, but can be compensated by mutations on the interacting partner. Here we extend the approach by systematically sampling alternate rigid body orientations to optimize the interactions in a binding mode specific manner. Using this protocol we designed a de novo hydrogen bond network at the DNase−immunity protein interface and confirmed the design with X-ray crystallographic analysis. Subsequent design of the second shell of interactions guided by insights from the crystal structure on tightly bound water molecules, conformational strain, and packing defects yielded new binding partners that exhibited specificities of at least 300-fold between the cognate and the non-cognate complexes. This multi-step approach should be applicable to the design of polar protein−protein interactions and contribute to the re-engineering of regulatory networks mediated by protein−protein interactions.

AB  - Computational design provides the opportunity to program protein–protein interactions for desired applications. We used de novo protein interface design to generate a pH-dependent Fc domain binding protein that buries immunoglobulin G (IgG) His-433. Using next-generation sequencing of naïve and selected pools of a library of design variants, we generated a molecular footprint of the designed binding surface, confirming the binding mode and guiding further optimization of the balance between affinity and pH sensitivity. In biolayer interferometry experiments, the optimized design binds IgG with a Kd of ∼4 nM at pH 8.2, and approximately 500-fold more weakly at pH 5.5. The protein is extremely stable, heat-resistant and highly expressed in bacteria, and allows pH-based control of binding for IgG affinity purification and diagnostic devices.

Baker, Nature 537, 320–327 (2016)], and to reengineer natural proteins to alter their dynamics [J. A. Davey, A. M. Damry, N. K. Goto, R. A. Chica, Nat. Chem. Biol. 13, 1280–1285 (2017)] or fold [P. A. Alexander, Y. He, Y. Chen, J. Orban, P. N. Bryan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 21149–21154 (2009)], the de novo design of closely related sequences which adopt well-defined but structurally divergent structures remains an outstanding challenge. We designed closely related sequences (over 94% identity) that can adopt two very different homotrimeric helical bundle conformations—one short (∼66 Å height) and the other long (∼100 Å height)—reminiscent of the conformational transition of viral fusion proteins. Crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic characterization shows that both the short- and long-state sequences fold as designed. We sought to design bistable sequences for which both states are accessible, and obtained a single designed protein sequence that populates either the short state or the long state depending on the measurement conditions. The design of sequences which are poised to adopt two very different conformations sets the stage for creating large-scale conformational switches between structurally divergent forms.

AB  - Computational grafting of functional motifs onto scaffold proteins is a promising way to engineer novel proteins with pre-specified functionalities. Typically, protein grafting involves the transplantation of protein side chains from a functional motif onto structurally homologous regions of scaffold proteins. Using this approach, we previously transplanted the human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes onto heterologous proteins to design novel “epitope-scaffold” antigens. However, side-chain grafting is limited by the availability of scaffolds with compatible backbone for a given epitope structure and offers no route to modify backbone structure to improve mimicry or binding affinity. To address this, we report here a new and more aggressive computational method—backbone grafting of linear motifs—that transplants the backbone and side chains of linear functional motifs onto scaffold proteins. To test this method, we first used side-chain grafting to design new 2F5 epitope scaffolds with improved biophysical characteristics. We then independently transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto three of the same parent scaffolds using the newly developed backbone grafting procedure. Crystal structures of side-chain and backbone grafting designs showed close agreement with both the computational models and the desired epitope structure. In two cases, backbone grafting scaffolds bound antibody 2F5 with 30- and 9-fold higher affinity than corresponding side-chain grafting designs. These results demonstrate that flexible backbone methods for epitope grafting can significantly improve binding affinities over those achieved by fixed backbone methods alone. Backbone grafting of linear motifs is a general method to transplant functional motifs when backbone remodeling of the target scaffold is necessary.

AB  - Cyclic symmetry is frequent in protein and peptide homo-oligomers, but extremely rare within a single chain, as it is not compatible with free N- and C-termini. Here we describe the computational design of mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins. Crystal structures of three C2- and C3-symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2-symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally-designed models with backbone heavy-atom RMSD values of 1 Å or better. Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.

AB  - We describe a general computational method for designing proteins that self-assemble to a desired symmetric architecture. Protein building blocks are docked together symmetrically to identify complementary packing arrangements, and low-energy protein-protein interfaces are then designed between the building blocks in order to drive self-assembly. We used trimeric protein building blocks to design a 24-subunit, 13-nm diameter complex with octahedral symmetry and a 12-subunit, 11-nm diameter complex with tetrahedral symmetry. The designed proteins assembled to the desired oligomeric states in solution, and the crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the resulting materials closely match the design models. The method can be used to design a wide variety of self-assembling protein nanomaterials.

AB  - <p>Members of the Zrt and Irt protein (ZIP) family are a central participant in transition metal homeostasis as they function to increase the cytosolic concentration of zinc and/or iron. However, the lack of a crystal structure hinders elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ZIP proteins. Here, we employed GREMLIN, a co-evolution-based contact prediction approach in conjunction with the Rosetta structure prediction program to construct a structural model of the human (h) ZIP4 transporter. The predicted contact data are best fit by modeling hZIP4 as a dimer. Mutagenesis of residues that comprise a central putative hZIP4 transmembrane transition metal coordination site in the structural model alter the kinetics and specificity of hZIP4. Comparison of the hZIP4 dimer model to all known membrane protein structures identifies the 12-transmembrane monomeric <i>Piriformospora indica</i> phosphate transporter (PiPT), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), as a likely structural homolog.</p>

AB  - We describe a computationally designed enzyme, formolase (FLS), which catalyzes the carboligation of three one-carbon formaldehyde molecules into one three-carbon dihydroxyacetone molecule. The existence of FLS enables the design of a new carbon fixation pathway, the formolase pathway, consisting of a small number of thermodynamically favorable chemical transformations that convert formate into a three-carbon sugar in central metabolism. The formolase pathway is predicted to use carbon more efficiently and with less backward flux than any naturally occurring one-carbon assimilation pathway. When supplemented with enzymes carrying out the other steps in the pathway, FLS converts formate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and other central metabolites in vitro. These results demonstrate how modern protein engineering and design tools can facilitate the construction of a completely new biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - Computational protein design strategies have been developed to reengineer protein–protein interfaces in an automated, generalizable fashion. In the past two years, these methods have been successfully applied to generate chimeric proteins and protein pairs with specificities different from naturally occurring protein–protein interactions. Although there are shortcomings in current approaches, both in the way conformational space is sampled and in the energy functions used to evaluate designed conformations, the successes suggest we are now entering an era in which computational methods can be used to modulate, reengineer and design protein–protein interaction networks in living cells.

AB  - Site-specific homing endonucleases are capable of inducing gene conversion via homologous recombination. Reprogramming their cleavage specificities allows the targeting of specific biological sites for gene correction or conversion. We used computational protein design to alter the cleavage specificity of I-MsoI for three contiguous base pair substitutions, resulting in an endonuclease whose activity and specificity for its new site rival that of wild-type I-MsoI for the original site. Concerted design for all simultaneous substitutions was more successful than a modular approach against individual substitutions, highlighting the importance of context-dependent redesign and optimization of protein–DNA interactions. We then used computational design based on the crystal structure of the designed complex, which revealed significant unanticipated shifts in DNA conformation, to create an endonuclease that specifically cleaves a site with four contiguous base pair substitutions. Our results demonstrate that specificity switches for multiple concerted base pair substitutions can be computationally designed, and that iteration between design and structure determination provides a route to large scale reprogramming of specificity.

We describe a rapid computational approach that identified three mutations within a model enzyme that produced a 10°C increase in apparent melting temperature Tm and a 30-fold increase in half-life at 50°C, with no reduction in catalytic efficiency. The effects of the mutations were synergistic, giving an increase in excess of the sum of their individual effects. The redesigned enzyme induced an increased, temperature-dependent bacterial growth rate under conditions that required its activity, thereby coupling molecular and metabolic engineering.

AB  - The human proteome is rich with protein kinases, and this richness has made the kinase of crucial importance in initiating and maintaining cell behavior. Elucidating cell signaling networks and manipulating their components to understand and alter behavior require well designed inhibitors. These inhibitors are needed in culture to cause and study network perturbations, and the same compounds can be used as drugs to treat disease. Understanding the structural biology of protein kinases in detail, including their commonalities, differences and modes of substrate interaction, is necessary for designing high quality inhibitors that will be of true use for cell biology and disease therapy. To this end, we here report on a structural analysis of all available active-conformation protein kinases, discussing residue conservation, the novel features of such conservation, unique properties of atypical kinases and variability in the context of substrate binding. We also demonstrate how this information can be used for structure prediction. Our findings will be of use not only in understanding protein kinase function and evolution, but they highlight the flaws inherent in kinase drug design as commonly practiced and dictate an appropriate strategy for the sophisticated design of specific inhibitors for use in the laboratory and disease therapy.

AB  - Guided by the recent success of empirical model predicting the folding rates of small two-state folding proteins from the relative contact order (CO) of their native structures, by a theoretical model of protein folding that predicts that logarithm of the folding rate decreases with the protein chain length L as L2/3, and by the finding that the folding rates of multistate folding proteins strongly correlate with their sizes and have very bad correlation with CO, we reexamined the dependence of folding rate on CO and L in attempt to find a structural parameter that determines folding rates for the totality of proteins. We show that the Abs_CO = CO × L, is able to predict rather accurately folding rates for both two-state and multistate folding proteins, as well as short peptides, and that this Abs_CO scales with the protein chain length as L0.70 ± 0.07 for the totality of studied single-domain proteins and peptides.

AB  - Protein L is a bacterial surface protein with 4−5 immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding domains (B1−B5), each of which appears to have two binding sites for Ig, corresponding to the two edges of its β-sheet. To verify these sites biochemically and to probe their relative contributions to the protein L−Ig κ light chain (κ) interaction, we compared the binding of PLW (the Y47W mutant of the B1 domain) to that of mutants designed to disrupt binding to sites 1 and 2, using gel filtration, BIAcore surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence titration, and solid-phase radioimmunoassays. Gel filtration experiments show that PLW binds κ both in 1:1 complexes and multivalently, consistent with two binding sites. Covalent dimers of the A20C and V51C mutants of PLW were prepared to eliminate site 1 and site 2 binding, respectively; both the A20C and V51C dimers bind κ in 1:1 complexes and multivalently, indicating that neither site 1 nor site 2 is solely responsible for κ binding. The A20R mutant was designed computationally to eliminate site 1 binding while preserving site 2 binding; consistent with this design, the A20R mutant binds κ in 1:1 complexes but not multivalently. To probe the contributions of amino acid side chains to binding, we prepared 75 point mutants spanning nearly every residue of PLW; BIAcore studies of these mutants revealed two binding-energy “hot spots” consistent with sites 1 and 2. These data indicate that PLW binds κ at both sites with similar affinities (high nanomolar), with the strongest contributions to the binding energy from Tyr34 (site 2) and Tyr36 (site 1). Compared to other protein−protein complexes, the binding is insensitive to amino acid substitutions at these sites, consistent with the large number of main chain interactions relative to side chain interactions. The strong binding of protein L to Ig κ light chains of various species may result from the ambidextrous binding of the B1−B5 domains and the unimportance of specific side chain interactions.

AB  - The ability of proteins and other macromolecules to interact with inorganic surfaces is essential to biological function. The proteins involved in these interactions are highly charged and often rich in carboxylic acid side chains1–5, but the structures of most protein–inorganic interfaces are unknown. We explored the possibility of systematically designing structured protein–mineral interfaces, guided by the example of ice-binding proteins, which present arrays of threonine residues (matched to the ice lattice) that order clathrate waters into an ice-like structure6. Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54 carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration, individual molecules bind independently to mica in the designed orientations, whereas at high K+ concentration, the designs form two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the inherent structural bias in the muscovite lattice to produce protein arrays ordered over tens of millimetres. Incorporation of designed protein–protein interactions preserving the match between the proteins and the K+ lattice led to extended self-assembled structures on mica: designed end-to-end interactions produced micrometre-long single-protein-diameter wires and a designed trimeric interface yielded extensive honeycomb arrays. The nearest-neighbour distances in these hexagonal arrays could be set digitally between 7.5 and 15.9 nanometres with 2.1-nanometre selectivity by changing the number of repeat units in the monomer. These results demonstrate that protein–inorganic lattice interactions can be systematically programmed and set the stage for designing protein–inorganic hybrid materials.

AB  - Amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's and prion diseases, are each associated with unbranched protein fibrils. Each fibril is made of a particular protein, yet they share common properties. One such property is nucleation-dependent fibril growth. Monomers of amyloid-forming proteins can remain in dissolved form for long periods, before rapidly assembly into fibrils. The lag before growth has been attributed to slow kinetics of formation of a nucleus, on which other molecules can deposit to form the fibril. We have explored the energetics of fibril formation, based on the known molecular structure of a fibril-forming peptide from the yeast prion, Sup35, using both classical and quantum (density functional theory) methods. We find that the energetics of fibril formation for the first three layers are cooperative using both methods. This cooperativity is consistent with the observation that formation of amyloid fibrils involves slow nucleation and faster growth.

AB  - The regular arrangements of β-strands around a central axis in β-barrels and of α-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of α-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with β-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of β-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of β-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI, and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.

AB  - β-sheet proteins carry out critical functions in biology, and hence are attractive scaffolds for computational protein design. Despite this potential, de novo design of all-β-sheet proteins from first principles lags far behind the design of all-α or mixed-αβ domains owing to their non-local nature and the tendency of exposed β-strand edges to aggregate. Through study of loops connecting unpaired β-strands (β-arches), we have identified a series of structural relationships between loop geometry, side chain directionality and β-strand length that arise from hydrogen bonding and packing constraints on regular β-sheet structures. We use these rules to de novo design jellyroll structures with double-stranded β-helices formed by eight antiparallel β-strands. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a hyperthermostable design closely matched the computational model, demonstrating accurate control over the β-sheet structure and loop geometry. Our results open the door to the design of a broad range of non-local β-sheet protein structures.

AB  - Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.

AB  - In nature, structural specificity in DNA and proteins is encoded differently: In DNA, specificity arises from modular hydrogen bonds in the core of the double helix, whereas in proteins, specificity arises largely from buried hydrophobic packing complemented by irregular peripheral polar interactions. Here, we describe a general approach for designing a wide range of protein homo-oligomers with specificity determined by modular arrays of central hydrogen-bond networks. We use the approach to design dimers, trimers, and tetramers consisting of two concentric rings of helices, including previously not seen triangular, square, and supercoiled topologies. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structures overall, and the hydrogen-bond networks in particular, are nearly identical to the design models, and the networks confer interaction specificity in vivo. The ability to design extensive hydrogen-bond networks with atomic accuracy enables the programming of protein interaction specificity for a broad range of synthetic biology applications; more generally, our results demonstrate that, even with the tremendous diversity observed in nature, there are fundamentally new modes of interaction to be discovered in proteins.

AB  - We describe a general computational approach to designing self-assembling helical filaments from monomeric proteins and use this approach to design proteins that assemble into micrometer-scale filaments with a wide range of geometries in vivo and in vitro. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six designs are close to the computational design models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.

We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs). We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43 nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.

AB  - We have developed an approach for determining NMR structures of proteins over 20 kDa that utilizes sparse distance restraints obtained using transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy experiments on perdeuterated samples to guide RASREC Rosetta NMR structure calculations. The method was tested on 11 proteins ranging from 15 to 40 kDa, seven of which were previously unsolved. The RASREC Rosetta models were in good agreement with models obtained using traditional NMR methods with larger restraint sets. In five cases X-ray structures were determined or were available, allowing comparison of the accuracy of the Rosetta models and conventional NMR models. In all five cases, the Rosetta models were more similar to the X-ray structures over both the backbone and side-chain conformations than the “best effort” structures determined by conventional methods. The incorporation of sparse distance restraints into RASREC Rosetta allows routine determination of high-quality solution NMR structures for proteins up to 40 kDa, and should be broadly useful in structural biology.

AB  - Symmetric protein dimers, trimers, and higher-order cyclic oligomers play key roles in many biological processes. However, structural studies of oligomeric systems by solution NMR can be difficult due to slow tumbling of the system and the difficulty in identifying NOE interactions across protein interfaces. Here, we present an automated method (RosettaOligomers) for determining the solution structures of oligomeric systems using only chemical shifts, sparse NOEs, and domain orientation restraints from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) without a need for a previously determined structure of the monomeric subunit. The method integrates previously developed Rosetta protocols for solving the structures of monomeric proteins using sparse NMR data and for predicting the structures of both nonintertwined and intertwined symmetric oligomers. We illustrated the performance of the method using a benchmark set of nine protein dimers, one trimer, and one tetramer with available experimental data and various interface topologies. The final converged structures are found to be in good agreement with both experimental data and previously published high-resolution structures. The new approach is more readily applicable to large oligomeric systems than conventional structure-determination protocols, which often require a large number of NOEs, and will likely become increasingly relevant as more high-molecular weight systems are studied by NMR.

AB  - Perturbation in the Dystroglycan (Dg)?Dystrophin (Dys) complex results in muscular dystrophies and brain abnormalities in human. Here we report that Drosophila is an excellent genetically tractable model to study muscular dystrophies and neuronal abnormalities caused by defects in this complex. Using a fluorescence polarization assay, we show a high conservation in Dg?Dys interaction between human and Drosophila. Genetic and RNAi-induced perturbations of Dg and Dys in Drosophila cause cell polarity and muscular dystrophy phenotypes: decreased mobility, age-dependent muscle degeneration and defective photoreceptor path-finding. Dg and Dys are required in targeting glial cells and neurons for correct neuronal migration. Importantly, we now report that Dg interacts with insulin receptor and Nck/Dock SH2/SH3-adaptor molecule in photoreceptor path-finding. This is the first demonstration of a genetic interaction between Dg and InR.

AB  - All-atom sampling is a critical and compute-intensive end stage to protein structural modeling. Because of the vast size and extreme ruggedness of conformational space, even close to the native structure, the high-resolution sampling problem is almost as difficult as predicting the rough fold of a protein. Here, we present a combination of new algorithms that considerably speed up the exploration of very rugged conformational landscapes and are capable of finding heretofore hidden low-energy states. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical workflow and can be parallelized on supercomputers with up to 128,000 compute cores with near perfect efficiency. Such scaling behavior is notable, as with Moore's law continuing only in the number of cores per chip, parallelizability is a critical property of new algorithms. Using the enhanced sampling power, we have uncovered previously invisible deficiencies in the Rosetta force field and created an extensive decoy training set for optimizing and testing force fields. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The energy of α helix formation is well known to be highly cooperative, but the origin and relative importance of the contributions to helical cooperativity have been unclear. Here we separate the energy of helix formation into short range and long range components by using two series of helical dimers of variable length. In one dimer series two monomeric helices interact by forming hydrogen bonds, while in the other they are coupled only through long range, primarily electrostatic interactions. Using Density Functional Theory, we find that approximately half of the cooperativity of helix formation is due to electrostatic interactions between residues, while the other half is due to nonadditive many-body effects brought about by redistribution of electron density with helix length.

AB  - Elicitation of antibodies against targets that are immunorecessive, cryptic, or transient in their native context has been a challenge for vaccine design. Here we demonstrate the elicitation of structure-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 gp41 epitope of the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant “2F5-epitope scaffolds” possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p < 0.04), while antibody responses against the graft—as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions—resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation.

AB  - In 2008, a successful computational design procedure was reported that yielded active enzyme catalysts for the Kemp elimination. Here, we studied these proteins together with a set of previously unpublished inactive designs to determine the sources of activity or lack thereof, and to predict which of the designed structures are most likely to be catalytic. Methods that range from quantum mechanics (QM) on truncated model systems to the treatment of the full protein with ONIOM QM/MM and AMBER molecular dynamics (MD) were explored. The most effective procedure involved molecular dynamics, and a general MD protocol was established. Substantial deviations from the ideal catalytic geometries were observed for a number of designs. Penetration of water into the catalytic site and insufficient residue-packing around the active site are the main factors that can cause enzyme designs to be inactive. Where in the past, computational evaluations of designed enzymes were too time-extensive for practical considerations, it has now become feasible to rank and refine candidates computationally prior to and in conjunction with experimentation, thus markedly increasing the efficiency of the enzyme design process.

T2  - The Journal of Physical Chemistry B
AB  - The conformations of proteins and protein−protein complexes observed in nature must be low in free energy relative to alternative (not observed) conformations, and it is plausible (but not absolutely necessary) that the electrostatic free energies of experimentally observed conformations are also low relative to other conformations. Starting from this assumption, we evaluate alternative models of electrostatic interactions in proteins by comparing the electrostatic free energies of native, nativelike, and non-native structures. We observe that the total electrostatic free energy computed using the Poisson−Boltzmann (PB) equation or the generalized Born (GB) model exhibits free energy gaps that are comparable to, or smaller than, the free energy gaps resulting from Coulomb interactions alone. Detailed characterization of the contributions of different atom types to the total electrostatic free energy showed that, although for most atoms unfavorable solvation energies associated with atom burial are more than compensated by attractive Coulomb interactions, Coulomb interactions do not become more favorable with burial for certain backbone atom types, suggesting inaccuracies in the treatment of backbone electrostatics. Sizable free energy gaps are obtained using simple distance-dependent dielectric models, suggesting their usefulness in approximating the attenuation of long range Coulomb interactions by induced polarization effects. Hydrogen bonding interactions appear to be better modeled with an explicitly orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding potential than with any of the purely electrostatic models of hydrogen bonds, as there are larger free energy gaps with the former. Finally, a combined electrostatics−hydrogen bonding potential is developed that appears to better capture the free energy differences between native, nativelike, and non-native proteins and protein−protein complexes than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding models alone.

AB  - Colicin endonucleases (DNases) are bound and inactivated by immunity (Im) proteins. Im proteins are broadly cross-reactive yet specific inhibitors binding cognate and non-cognate DNases with Kd values that vary between 10−4 and 10−14 M, characteristics that are explained by a ‘dual-recognition’ mechanism. In this work, we addressed for the first time the energetics of Im protein recognition by colicin DNases through a combination of E9 DNase alanine scanning and double-mutant cycles (DMCs) coupled with kinetic and calorimetric analyses of cognate Im9 and non-cognate Im2 binding, as well as computational analysis of alanine scanning and DMC data. We show that differential ΔΔGs observed for four E9 DNase residues cumulatively distinguish cognate Im9 association from non-cognate Im2 association. E9 DNase Phe86 is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the centre of the interface, which is coordinated by conserved and variable hotspot residues of the cognate Im protein. Experimental DMC analysis reveals that only modest coupling energies to Im9 residues are observed, in agreement with calculated DMCs using the program ROSETTA and consistent with the largely hydrophobic nature of E9 DNase–Im9 specificity contacts. Computed values for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants showed reasonable agreement with experimental ΔΔG data, particularly for interactions not mediated by interfacial water molecules. ΔΔG predictions for residues that contact buried water molecules calculated using solvated rotamer models met with mixed success; however, we were able to predict with a high degree of accuracy the location and energetic contribution of one such contact. Our study highlights how colicin DNases are able to utilise both conserved and variable amino acids to distinguish cognate from non-cognate Im proteins, with the energetic contributions of the conserved residues modulated by neighbouring specificity sites.

AB  - Enzymes use substrate-binding energy to promote ground-state association and to selectively lower the energy of the reaction transition state. Thyme et al. have determined that for the monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI, which cleaves double-stranded DNA with high sequence specificity, mutation in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme is responsible for increasing certain kinetic parameters (KD and KM), whereas mutation in the C-terminal domain decreases another kinetic parameter (kcat). This unexpected asymmetry in the utilization of enzyme–substrate binding energy for catalysis may enable researchers to more effectively re-engineer endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other biomedical applications.

AB  - De novo protein structure prediction requires location of the lowest energy state of the polypeptide chain among a vast set of possible conformations. Powerful approaches include conformational space annealing, in which search progressively focuses on the most promising regions of conformational space, and genetic algorithms, in which features of the best conformations thus far identified are recombined. We describe a new approach that combines the strengths of these two approaches. Protein conformations are projected onto a discrete feature space which includes backbone torsion angles, secondary structure, and beta pairings. For each of these there is one “native” value: the one found in the native structure. We begin with a large number of conformations generated in independent Monte Carlo structure prediction trajectories from Rosetta. Native values for each feature are predicted from the frequencies of feature value occurrences and the energy distribution in conformations containing them. A second round of structure prediction trajectories are then guided by the predicted native feature distributions. We show that native features can be predicted at much higher than background rates, and that using the predicted feature distributions improves structure prediction in a benchmark of 28 proteins. The advantages of our approach are that features from many different input structures can be combined simultaneously without producing atomic clashes or otherwise physically inviable models, and that the features being recombined have a relatively high chance of being correct.

AB  - Statherin is an enamel pellicle protein that inhibits hydroxyapatite (HAP) nucleation and growth, lubricates the enamel surface, and is recognized by oral bacteria in periodontal diseases. We report here from solid-state NMR measurements that the protein's C-terminal region folds into an α-helix upon adsorption to HAP crystals. This region contains the binding sites for bacterial fimbriae that mediate bacterial cell adhesion to the surface of the tooth. The helical segment is shown through long-range distance measurements to fold back onto the intermediate region (residues Y16–P28) defining the global fold of the protein. Statherin, previously shown to be unstructured in solution, undergoes conformation selection on its substrate mineral surface. This surface-induced folding of statherin can be related to its functionality in inhibiting HAP crystal growth and can explain how oral pathogens selectively recognize HAP-bound statherin.

AB  - Determination of high-quality small protein structures by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods generally requires acquisition and analysis of an extensive set of structural constraints. The process generally demands extensive backbone and sidechain resonance assignments, and weeks or even months of data collection and interpretation. Here we demonstrate rapid and high-quality protein NMR structure generation using CS-Rosetta with a perdeuterated protein sample made at a significantly reduced cost using new bacterial culture condensation methods. Our strategy provides the basis for a high-throughput approach for routine, rapid, high-quality structure determination of small proteins. As an example, we demonstrate the determination of a high-quality 3D structure of a small 8 kDa protein, E. coli cold shock protein A (CspA), using <4 days of data collection and fully automated data analysis methods together with CS-Rosetta. The resulting CspA structure is highly converged and in excellent agreement with the published crystal structure, with a backbone RMSD value of 0.5 Å, an all atom RMSD value of 1.2 Å to the crystal structure for well-defined regions, and RMSD value of 1.1 Å to crystal structure for core, non-solvent exposed sidechain atoms. Cross validation of the structure with 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY data obtained with a perdeuterated 15N, 13C-enriched 13CH3 methyl protonated CspA sample confirms that essentially all of these independently-interpreted NOE-based constraints are already satisfied in each of the 10 CS-Rosetta structures. By these criteria, the CS-Rosetta structure generated by fully automated analysis of data for a perdeuterated sample provides an accurate structure of CspA. This represents a general approach for rapid, automated structure determination of small proteins by NMR.

AB  - Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.

AB  - The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) gp120 and gp41 mediate entry and are the targets for neutralizing antibodies. Within gp41, a continuous epitope defined by the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5, is one of the few conserved sites accessible to antibodies on the functional HIV Env spike. Recently, as an initial attempt at structure-guided design, we transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto several non-HIV acceptor scaffold proteins that we termed epitope scaffolds (ES). As immunogens, these ES proteins elicited antibodies with exquisite binding specificity matching that of the 2F5 antibody. These novel 2F5 epitope scaffolds presented us with the opportunity to test heterologous prime∶boost immunization strategies to selectively boost antibody responses against the engrafted gp41 2F5 epitope. Such strategies might be employed to target conserved but poorly immunogenic sites on the HIV-1 Env, and, more generally, other structurally defined pathogen targets. Here, we assessed ES prime∶boosting by measuring epitope specific serum antibody titers by ELISA and B cell responses by ELISpot analysis using both free 2F5 peptide and an unrelated ES protein as probes. We found that the heterologous ES prime∶boosting immunization regimen elicits cross-reactive humoral responses to the structurally constrained 2F5 epitope target, and that incorporating a promiscuous T cell helper epitope in the immunogens resulted in higher antibody titers against the 2F5 graft, but did not result in virus neutralization. Interestingly, two epitope scaffolds (ES1 and ES2), which did not elicit a detectable 2F5 epitope-specific response on their own, boosted such responses when primed with the ES5. Together, these results indicate that heterologous ES prime∶boost immunization regimens effectively focus the humoral immune response on the structurally defined and immunogen-conserved HIV-1 2F5 epitope.

AB  - We describe a procedure for designing proteins with backbones produced by varying the parameters in the Crick coiled coil–generating equations. Combinatorial design calculations identify low-energy sequences for alternative helix supercoil arrangements, and the helices in the lowest-energy arrangements are connected by loop building. We design an antiparallel monomeric untwisted three-helix bundle with 80-residue helices, an antiparallel monomeric right-handed four-helix bundle, and a pentameric parallel left-handed five-helix bundle. The designed proteins are extremely stable (extrapolated ΔGfold > 60 kilocalories per mole), and their crystal structures are close to those of the design models with nearly identical core packing between the helices. The approach enables the custom design of hyperstable proteins with fine-tuned geometries for a wide range of applications.

AB  - Recent efforts to design de novo or redesign the sequence and structure of proteins using computational techniques have met with significant success. Most, if not all, of these computational methodologies attempt to model atomic-level interactions, and hence high-resolution structural characterization of the designed proteins is critical for evaluating the atomic-level accuracy of the underlying design force-fields. We previously used our computational protein design protocol RosettaDesign to completely redesign the sequence of the activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase A2. With 68% of the wild-type sequence changed, the designed protein, AYEdesign, is over 10 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein. Here, we describe the high-resolution crystal structure and solution NMR structure of AYEdesign, which show that the experimentally determined backbone and side-chains conformations are effectively superimposable with the computational model at atomic resolution. To isolate the origins of the remarkable stabilization, we have designed and characterized a new series of procarboxypeptidase mutants that gain significant thermodynamic stability with a minimal number of mutations; one mutant gains more than 5 kcal/mol of stability over the wild-type protein with only four amino acid changes. We explore the relationship between force-field smoothing and conformational sampling by comparing the experimentally determined free energies of the overall design and these focused subsets of mutations to those predicted using modified force-fields, and both fixed and flexible backbone sampling protocols.

AU  - Chivian, Dylan

T2  - Nucleic Acids Research
AB  - The accuracy of a homology model based on the structure of a distant relative or other topologically equivalent protein is primarily limited by the quality of the alignment. Here we describe a systematic approach for sequence-to-structure alignment, called ‘K*Sync’, in which alignments are generated by dynamic programming using a scoring function that combines information on many protein features, including a novel measure of how obligate a sequence region is to the protein fold. By systematically varying the weights on the different features that contribute to the alignment score, we generate very large ensembles of diverse alignments, each optimal under a particular constellation of weights. We investigate a variety of approaches to select the best models from the ensemble, including consensus of the alignments, a hydrophobic burial measure, low- and high-resolution energy functions, and combinations of these evaluation methods. The effect on model quality and selection resulting from loop modeling and backbone optimization is also studied. The performance of the method on a benchmark set is reported and shows the approach to be effective at both generating and selecting accurate alignments. The method serves as the foundation of the homology modeling module in the Robetta server.

TI  - Improved beta-protein structure prediction by multilevel optimization of nonlocal strand pairings and local backbone conformation
AU  - Bradley, Philip
AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics
AB  - Proteins with complex, nonlocal beta-sheets are challenging for de novo structure prediction, due in part to the difficulty of efficiently sampling long-range strand pairings. We present a new, multilevel approach to beta-sheet structure prediction that circumvents this difficulty by reformulating structure generation in terms of a folding tree. Nonlocal connections in this tree allow us to explicitly sample alternative beta-strand pairings while simultaneously exploring local conformational space using backbone torsion-space moves. An iterative, energy-biased resampling strategy is used to explore the space of beta-strand pairings; we expect that such a strategy will be generally useful for searching large conformational spaces with a high degree of combinatorial complexity.

AB  - With more than 60,000 structures now available in the Protein Data Bank, it is frequently possible to create homology-based models to help solve the X-ray crystal structure of a protein with an unknown three-dimensional structure. But current techniques usually fail when the protein of interest has less than 30% sequence identity to known structures. A new method able to overcome this limitation has been developed and used successfully in 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction datasets that could not be solved by conventional means. The new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for more than half the cases in which current methods fail, as long as resolution is 3.2 Å or better, with four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with more than 20% sequence identity.

AB  - The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the “ideality” of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.

AB  - The prediction of functional sites in newly solved protein structures is a challenge for computational structural biology. Most methods for approaching this problem use evolutionary conservation as the primary indicator of the location of functional sites. However, sequence conservation reflects not only evolutionary selection at functional sites to maintain protein function, but also selection throughout the protein to maintain the stability of the folded state. To disentangle sequence conservation due to protein functional constraints from sequence conservation due to protein structural constraints, we use all atom computational protein design methodology to predict sequence profiles expected under solely structural constraints, and to compute the free energy difference between the naturally occurring amino acid and the lowest free energy amino acid at each position. We show that functional sites are more likely than non-functional sites to have computed sequence profiles which differ significantly from the naturally occurring sequence profiles and to have residues with sub-optimal free energies, and that incorporation of these two measures improves sequence based prediction of protein functional sites. The combined sequence and structure based functional site prediction method has been implemented in a publicly available web server.

AU  - Qian, Bin

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - Accurate high-resolution refinement of protein structure models is a formidable challenge because of the delicate balance of forces in the native state, the difficulty in sampling the very large number of alternative tightly packed conformations, and the inaccuracies in current force fields. Indeed, energy-based refinement of comparative models generally leads to degradation rather than improvement in model quality, and, hence, most current comparative modeling procedures omit physically based refinement. However, despite their inaccuracies, current force fields do contain information that is orthogonal to the evolutionary information on which comparative models are based, and, hence, refinement might be able to improve comparative models if the space that is sampled is restricted sufficiently so that false attractors are avoided. Here, we use the principal components of the variation of backbone structures within a homologous family to define a small number of evolutionarily favored sampling directions and show that model quality can be improved by energy-based optimization along these directions.

AB  - A correct alignment is an essential requirement in homology modeling. Yet in order to bridge the structural gap between template and target, which may not only involve loop rearrangements, but also shifts of secondary structure elements and repacking of core residues, high-resolution refinement methods with full atomic details are needed. Here, we describe four approaches that address this “last mile of the protein folding problem” and have performed well during CASP8, yielding physically realistic models: YASARA, which runs molecular dynamics simulations of models in explicit solvent, using a new partly knowledge-based all atom force field derived from Amber, whose parameters have been optimized to minimize the damage done to protein crystal structures. The LEE-SERVER, which makes extensive use of conformational space annealing to create alignments, to help Modeller build physically realistic models while satisfying input restraints from templates and CHARMM stereochemistry, and to remodel the side-chains. ROSETTA, whose high resolution refinement protocol combines a physically realistic all atom force field with Monte Carlo minimization to allow the large conformational space to be sampled quickly. And finally UNDERTAKER, which creates a pool of candidate models from various templates and then optimizes them with an adaptive genetic algorithm, using a primarily empirical cost function that does not include bond angle, bond length, or other physics-like terms.

AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an interspecies protein transport machine that plays a major role in interactions of Gram-negative bacteria with animals and plants by delivering bacterial effector proteins into host cells. T3SSs span both membranes of Gram-negative bacteria by forming a structure of connected oligomeric rings termed the needle complex (NC). Here, the localization of subunits in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium T3SS NC were probed via mass spectrometry-assisted identification of chemical cross-links in intact NC preparations. Cross-links between amino acids near the amino terminus of the outer membrane ring component InvG and the carboxyl terminus of the inner membrane ring component PrgH and between the two inner membrane components PrgH and PrgK allowed for spatial localization of the three ring components within the electron density map structures of NCs. Mutational and biochemical analysis demonstrated that the amino terminus of InvG and the carboxyl terminus of PrgH play a critical role in the assembly and function of the T3SS apparatus. Analysis of an InvG mutant indicates that the structure of the InvG oligomer can affect the switching of the T3SS substrate to translocon and effector components. This study provides insights into how structural organization of needle complex base components promotes T3SS assembly and function.
IMPORTANCE Many biological macromolecular complexes are composed of symmetrical homomers, which assemble into larger structures. Some complexes, such as secretion systems, span biological membranes, forming hydrophilic domains to move substrates across lipid bilayers. Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) deliver bacterial effector proteins directly to the host cell cytoplasm and allow for critical interactions between many Gram-negative pathogenic bacterial species and their hosts. Progress has been made towards the goal of determining the three-dimensional structure of the secretion apparatus by determination of high-resolution crystal structures of individual protein subunits and low-resolution models of the assembly, using reconstructions of cryoelectron microscopy images. However, a more refined picture of the localization of periplasmic ring structures within the assembly and their interactions has only recently begun to emerge. This work localizes T3SS transmembrane rings and identifies structural elements that affect substrate switching and are essential to the assembly of components that are inserted into host cell membranes.

AB  - The design of new enzymes for reactions not catalysed by naturally occurring biocatalysts is a challenge for protein engineering and is a critical test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis. Here we describe the computational design of eight enzymes that use two different catalytic motifs to catalyse the Kemp elimination—a model reaction for proton transfer from carbon—with measured rate enhancements of up to 105 and multiple turnovers. Mutational analysis confirms that catalysis depends on the computationally designed active sites, and a high-resolution crystal structure suggests that the designs have close to atomic accuracy. Application of in vitro evolution to enhance the computational designs produced a >200-fold increase in kcat/Km (kcat/Km of 2,600 M-1s-1 and kcat/kuncat of >106). These results demonstrate the power of combining computational protein design with directed evolution for creating new enzymes, and we anticipate the creation of a wide range of useful new catalysts in the future.

AB  - The prediction of the structures of proteins without detectable sequence similarity to any protein of known structure remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we report significant progress in this area. We first describe de novo blind  structure predictions of unprecendented accuracy we made for two proteins in large families in the recent CASP11 blind test of protein structure prediction methods by incorporating residue–residue co-evolution information in the Rosetta structure prediction program. We then describe the use of this method to generate structure models for 58 of the 121 large protein families in prokaryotes for which three-dimensional structures are not available. These models, which are posted online for public access, provide structural information for the over 400,000 proteins belonging to the 58 families and suggest hypotheses about mechanism for the subset for which the function is known, and hypotheses about function for the remainder.

TI  - Low free energy cost of very long loop insertions in proteins
AU  - Scalley-Kim, Michelle

AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Protein Science
AB  - Long insertions into a loop of a folded host protein are expected to have destabilizing effects because of the entropic cost associated with loop closure unless the inserted sequence adopts a folded structure with amino- and carboxy-termini in close proximity. A loop entropy reduction screen based on this concept was used in an attempt to retrieve folded sequences from random sequence libraries. A library of long random sequences was inserted into a loop of the SH2 domain, displayed on the surface of M13 phage, and the inserted sequences that did not disrupt SH2 function were retrieved by panning using beads coated with a phosphotyrosine containing SH2 peptide ligand. Two sequences of a library of 2 × 108 sequences were isolated after multiple rounds of panning, and were found to have recovery levels similar to the wild-type SH2 domain and to be relatively intolerant to further mutation in PCR mutagenesis experiments. Surprisingly, although these inserted sequences exhibited little nonrandom structure, they do not significantly destabilize the host SH2 domain. Additional insertion variants recovered at lower levels in the panning experiments were also found to have a minimal effect on the stability and peptide-binding function of the SH2 domain. The additional level of selection present in the panning experiments is likely to involve in vivo folding and assembly, as there was a rough correlation between recovery levels in the phage-panning experiments and protein solubility. The finding that loop insertions of 60–80 amino acids have minimal effects on SH2 domain stability suggests that the free energy cost of inserting long loops may be considerably less than polymer theory estimates based on the entropic cost of loop closure, and, hence, that loop insertion may have provided an evolutionary route to multidomain protein structures.

AB  - Advances over the past few years have begun to enable prediction and design of macromolecular structures at near-atomic accuracy. Progress has stemmed from the development of reasonably accurate and efficiently computed all-atom potential functions as well as effective conformational sampling strategies appropriate for searching a highly rugged energy landscape, both driven by feedback from structure prediction and design tests. A unified energetic and kinematic framework in the Rosetta program allows a wide range of molecular modeling problems, from fibril structure prediction to RNA folding to the design of new protein interfaces, to be readily investigated and highlights areas for improvement. The methodology enables the creation of novel molecules with useful functions and holds promise for accelerating experimental structural inference. Emerging connections to crystallographic phasing, NMR modeling, and lower-resolution approaches are described and critically assessed.

AB  - The ability to precisely design large proteins with diverse shapes would enable applications ranging from the design of protein binders that wrap around their target to the positioning of multiple functional sites in specified orientations. We describe a protein backbone design method for generating a wide range of rigid fusions between helix-containing proteins and use it to design 75,000 structurally unique junctions between monomeric and homo-oligomeric de novo designed and ankyrin repeat proteins (RPs). Of the junction designs that were experimentally characterized, 82% have circular dichroism and solution small-angle X-ray scattering profiles consistent with the design models and are stable at 95 °C. Crystal structures of four designed junctions were in close agreement with the design models with rmsds ranging from 0.9 to 1.6 Å. Electron microscopic images of extended tetrameric structures and ∼10-nm-diameter “L” and “V” shapes generated using the junctions are close to the design models, demonstrating the control the rigid junctions provide for protein shape sculpting over multiple nanometer length scales.

T2  - Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
AB  - In this article, I summarize recent work from my group directed towards developing an improved model of intra and intermolecular interactions and applying this improved model to the prediction and design of macromolecular structures and interactions. Prediction and design applications can be of great biological interest in their own right, and also provide very stringent and objective tests which drive the improvement of the model and increases in fundamental understanding. I emphasize the results from the prediction and design tests that suggest progress is being made in high-resolution modelling, and that there is hope for reliably and accurately computing structural biology.

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - Reliable structure-prediction methods for membrane proteins are important because the experimental determination of high-resolution membrane protein structures remains very difficult, especially for eukaryotic proteins. However, membrane proteins are typically longer than 200 aa and represent a formidable challenge for structure prediction. We have developed a method for predicting the structures of large membrane proteins by constraining helix–helix packing arrangements at particular positions predicted from sequence or identified by experiments. We tested the method on 12 membrane proteins of diverse topologies and functions with lengths ranging between 190 and 300 residues. Enforcing a single constraint during the folding simulations enriched the population of near-native models for 9 proteins. In 4 of the cases in which the constraint was predicted from the sequence, 1 of the 5 lowest energy models was superimposable within 4 Å on the native structure. Near-native structures could also be selected for heme-binding and pore-forming domains from simulations in which pairs of conserved histidine-chelating hemes and one experimentally determined salt bridge were constrained, respectively. These results suggest that models within 4 Å of the native structure can be achieved for complex membrane proteins if even limited information on residue-residue interactions can be obtained from protein structure databases or experiments.

AB  - The prediction of the structures and interactions of biological macromolecules at the atomic level and the design of new structures and interactions are critical tests of our understanding of the interatomic interactions that underlie molecular biology. Equally important, the capability to accurately predict and design macromolecular structures and interactions would streamline the interpretation of genome sequence information and allow the creation of macromolecules with new and useful functions. This review summarizes recent progress in modeling that suggests that we are entering an era in which high-resolution prediction and design will make increasingly important contributions to biology and medicine.

AU  - André, Ingemar

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - Biological supramolecular systems are commonly built up by the self-assembly of identical protein subunits to produce symmetrical oligomers with cyclical, icosahedral, or helical symmetry that play roles in processes ranging from allosteric control and molecular transport to motor action. The large size of these systems often makes them difficult to structurally characterize using experimental techniques. We have developed a computational protocol to predict the structure of symmetrical protein assemblies based on the structure of a single subunit. The method carries out simultaneous optimization of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom, while restricting the search space to symmetrical conformations. Using this protocol, we can reconstruct, starting from the structure of a single subunit, the structure of cyclic oligomers and the icosahedral virus capsid of satellite panicum virus using a rigid backbone approximation. We predict the oligomeric state of EscJ from the type III secretion system both in its proposed cyclical and crystallized helical form. Finally, we show that the method can recapitulate the structure of an amyloid-like fibril formed by the peptide NNQQNY from the yeast prion protein Sup35 starting from the amino acid sequence alone and searching the complete space of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom.

AB  - Significance
            Almost all proteins fold to their lowest free energy state, which is determined by their amino acid sequence. Computational protein design has primarily focused on finding sequences that have very low energy in the target designed structure. However, what is most relevant during folding is not the absolute energy of the folded state but the energy difference between the folded state and the lowest-lying alternative states. We describe a deep learning approach that captures aspects of the folding landscape, in particular the presence of structures in alternative energy minima, and show that it can enhance current protein design methods.
          , 
            The protein design problem is to identify an amino acid sequence that folds to a desired structure. Given Anfinsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis of folding, this can be recast as finding an amino acid sequence for which the desired structure is the lowest energy state. As this calculation involves not only all possible amino acid sequences but also, all possible structures, most current approaches focus instead on the more tractable problem of finding the lowest-energy amino acid sequence for the desired structure, often checking by protein structure prediction in a second step that the desired structure is indeed the lowest-energy conformation for the designed sequence, and typically discarding a large fraction of designed sequences for which this is not the case. Here, we show that by backpropagating gradients through the transform-restrained Rosetta (trRosetta) structure prediction network from the desired structure to the input amino acid sequence, we can directly optimize over all possible amino acid sequences and all possible structures in a single calculation. We find that trRosetta calculations, which consider the full conformational landscape, can be more effective than Rosetta single-point energy estimations in predicting folding and stability of de novo designed proteins. We compare sequence design by conformational landscape optimization with the standard energy-based sequence design methodology in Rosetta and show that the former can result in energy landscapes with fewer alternative energy minima. We show further that more funneled energy landscapes can be designed by combining the strengths of the two approaches: the low-resolution trRosetta model serves to disfavor alternative states, and the high-resolution Rosetta model serves to create a deep energy minimum at the design target structure.

AB  - Filling in the protein fold picture
            
              Fewer than a third of the 14,849 known protein families have at least one member with an experimentally determined structure. This leaves more than 5000 protein families with no structural information. Protein modeling using residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary data has been successful in modeling unknown structures, but it requires large numbers of aligned sequences. Ovchinnikov
              et al.
              augmented such sequence alignments with metagenome sequence data (see the Perspective by Söding). They determined the number of sequences required to allow modeling, developed criteria for model quality, and, where possible, improved modeling by matching predicted contacts to known structures.

            Combining metagenome data with protein structure prediction generates models for 614 families with unknown structures.
          , 
            Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still ~5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact-based structure matching, and Rosetta structure calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the Protein Data Bank. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the Protein Structure Initiative at a fraction of the cost.

              Proteins represent the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals for a diverse range of clinical applications. Computational protein design has the potential to create a novel class of therapeutics with tunable biophysical properties. However, the immune system reacts to T-cell epitope sequences in non-human proteins, leading to neutralization and elimination by the immune system. Here, we combine machine learning with structure-based protein design to identify and redesign T-cell epitopes without disrupting function of the target protein. We test the method experimentally, removing T-cell epitopes from GFP and
              Pseudomonas
              exotoxin A while maintaining function.

              Immune responses can make protein therapeutics ineffective or even dangerous. We describe a general computational protein design method for reducing immunogenicity by eliminating known and predicted T-cell epitopes and maximizing the content of human peptide sequences without disrupting protein structure and function. We show that the method recapitulates previous experimental results on immunogenicity reduction, and we use it to disrupt T-cell epitopes in GFP and
              Pseudomonas
              exotoxin A without disrupting function.

TI  - Robust and accurate prediction of residue–residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information
AU  - Ovchinnikov, Sergey

AU  - Baker, David
T2  - eLife
AB  - Do the amino acid sequence identities of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution? If so, such covariance could be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes. We find that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein–protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. We use this method to make subunit contact predictions for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures, and present models based on these predictions for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter.
          , 
            Proteins are considered the ‘workhorse molecules’ of life and they are involved in virtually everything that cells do. Proteins are strings of amino acids that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape. Proteins must have the correct shape to function properly, as they often work by binding to other proteins or molecules—much like a key fitting into a lock. Working out the structure of a protein can, therefore, provide major insights into how the protein does its job.
            Two or more proteins can bind together and form a complex to perform various tasks; and solving the structures of these complexes can be challenging, even if the structures of the protein subunits are known. Now, Ovchinnikov, Kamisetty, and Baker have developed a method for predicting which parts of the proteins make contact with each other in a two-protein complex.
            Different species can have copies of the same proteins; but a copy from one species might have different amino acids at certain positions when compared to a related copy from another species. As such, when pairs of interacting proteins from different species are compared, there will be many positions in the two proteins that vary. However, if the amino acid at a position in one protein (let's call it ‘X’) varies, and the amino acid at, say, position ‘Y’ in the other protein also varies such that for any given amino acid at position Y there is often a specific amino acid at position X; positions X and Y are said to ‘co-vary’. Ovchinnikov et al. noticed that when a pair of amino acids (one from each protein in a two-protein complex) co-varied, these two amino acids tended to make contact with each other at the protein–protein interface.
            Ovchinnikov et al. used the new method to make predictions about the protein–protein interfaces in 28 protein complexes found in bacteria, and also to make a prediction about the interface between protein subunits in the bacterial ribosome. When these predictions were checked against the actual structures, which were all known beforehand, they were found to be accurate if the number of copies of each protein being compared is greater than the average length of the two proteins.
            Ovchinnikov et al. went on to predict the amino acids on the protein–protein interfaces for another 36 bacterial protein complexes with unknown structures, and to present models for four larger complexes. The next challenge is to extend the method to protein complexes that are found only in eukaryotes (i.e., not in bacteria). Since the number of related copies for eukaryotic proteins tends to be smaller, there are fewer proteins to compare and it is therefore harder to detect ‘covariation’ when it occurs.

AB  - Formation of many dsDNA viruses begins with the assembly of a procapsid, containing scaffolding proteins and a multisubunit portal but lacking DNA, which matures into an infectious virion. This process, conserved among dsDNA viruses such as herpes viruses and bacteriophages, is key to forming infectious virions. Bacteriophage P22 has served as a model system for this study in the past several decades. However, how capsid assembly is initiated, where and how scaffolding proteins bind to coat proteins in the procapsid, and the conformational changes upon capsid maturation still remain elusive. Here, we report Cα backbone models for the P22 procapsid and infectious virion derived from electron cryomicroscopy density maps determined at 3.8- and 4.0-Å resolution, respectively, and the first procapsid structure at subnanometer resolution without imposing symmetry. The procapsid structures show the scaffolding protein interacting electrostatically with the N terminus (N arm) of the coat protein through its C-terminal helix-loop-helix motif, as well as unexpected interactions between 10 scaffolding proteins and the 12-fold portal located at a unique vertex. These suggest a critical role for the scaffolding proteins both in initiating the capsid assembly at the portal vertex and propagating its growth on a
              T
               = 7 icosahedral lattice. Comparison of the procapsid and the virion backbone models reveals coordinated and complex conformational changes. These structural observations allow us to propose a more detailed molecular mechanism for the scaffolding-mediated capsid assembly initiation including portal incorporation, release of scaffolding proteins upon DNA packaging, and maturation into infectious virions.

AB  - The prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence is a grand challenge of computational molecular biology. By using a combination of improved low- and high-resolution conformational sampling methods, improved atomically detailed potential functions that capture the jigsaw puzzle–like packing of protein cores, and high-performance computing, high-resolution structure prediction (<1.5 angstroms) can be achieved for small protein domains (<85 residues). The primary bottleneck to consistent high-resolution prediction appears to be conformational sampling.

AB  - The prediction and design at the atomic level of membrane protein structures and interactions is a critical but unsolved challenge. To address this problem, we have developed an all-atom physical model that describes intraprotein and protein–solvent interactions in the membrane environment. We evaluated the ability of the model to recapitulate the energetics and structural specificities of polytopic membrane proteins by using a battery of
              in silico
              prediction and design tests. First, in side-chain packing and design tests, the model successfully predicts the side-chain conformations at 73% of nonexposed positions and the native amino acid identities at 34% of positions in naturally occurring membrane proteins. Second, the model predicts significant energy gaps between native and nonnative structures of transmembrane helical interfaces and polytopic membrane proteins. Third, distortions in transmembrane helices are successfully recapitulated in docking experiments by using fragments of ideal helices judiciously defined around helical kinks. Finally,
              de novo
              structure prediction reaches near-atomic accuracy (<2.5 Å) for several small membrane protein domains (<150 residues). The success of the model highlights the critical role of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stability and structural specificity of membrane protein structures and sets the stage for the high-resolution prediction and design of complex membrane protein architectures.
