AB  - Natural molecular machines contain protein components that undergo motion relative to each other. Designing such mechanically constrained nanoscale protein architectures with internal degrees of freedom is an outstanding challenge for computational protein design. Here we explore the de novo construction of protein machinery from designed axle and rotor components with internal cyclic or dihedral symmetry. We find that the axle-rotor systems assemble in vitro and in vivo as designed. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we find that these systems populate conformationally variable relative orientations reflecting the symmetry of the coupled components and the computationally designed interface energy landscape. These mechanical systems with internal degrees of freedom are a step toward the design of genetically encodable nanomachines.

            Steps toward a nanomachine
            
              Protein rotary machines such as ATP synthase contain axle-like and ring-like components and couple biochemical energy to the mechanical work of rotating the components relative to each other. Courbet
              et al
              . have taken a step toward designing such axel-rotor nanomachines. A structural requirement is that interactions between the components must be strong enough to allow assembly but still allow different rotational states to be populated. The authors met this design challenge and computationally designed ring-like protein topologies (rotors) with a range of inner diameters that accommodate designed axle-like binding partners. The systems assemble and populate the different rotational states anticipated by the designs. These rotational energy landscapes provide one of two needed elements for a directional motor. —VV

AB  - Proteins can be designed that bind to specific patches on target proteins to alter their subsequent interactions.
          , 
            We describe a general computational method for designing proteins that bind a surface patch of interest on a target macromolecule. Favorable interactions between disembodied amino acid residues and the target surface are identified and used to anchor de novo designed interfaces. The method was used to design proteins that bind a conserved surface patch on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus. After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model. Such designed binding proteins may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.

Unfortunately, this selectivity has evolved for cellular purposes and may not promote the sorts of reactions chemists are seeking to enhance (see the Perspective by

            Synthetic enzymes catalyze a carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction with high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity.

            The Diels-Alder reaction is a cornerstone in organic synthesis, forming two carbon-carbon bonds and up to four new stereogenic centers in one step. No naturally occurring enzymes have been shown to catalyze bimolecular Diels-Alder reactions. We describe the de novo computational design and experimental characterization of enzymes catalyzing a bimolecular Diels-Alder reaction with high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structure matches the design for the most active of the enzymes, and binding site substitutions reprogram the substrate specificity. Designed stereoselective catalysts for carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions should be broadly useful in synthetic chemistry.

AB  - Examining the Backbone
            
              Determination of tertiary protein structures by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) currently relies heavily on side-chain NMR data. The assignment of side-chain atoms is challenging. In addition, proteins larger than 15 kilodaltons (kD) must be deuterated to improve resolution and this eliminates the possibility of measuring long-range interproton distance constraints. Now

              , published online 4 February) use backbone-only NMR data—chemical shifts, residual dipolar coupling, and backbone amide proton distances—available from highly deuterated proteins to guide conformational searching in the Rosetta structure prediction protocol. Using this new protocol, they were able to generate accurate structures for proteins of up to 25 kD.

            Protein structures can be determined by using the limited nuclear magnetic resonance information obtainable for larger proteins.
          , 
            Conventional protein structure determination from nuclear magnetic resonance data relies heavily on side-chain proton-to-proton distances. The necessary side-chain resonance assignment, however, is labor intensive and prone to error. Here we show that structures can be accurately determined without nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information on the side chains for proteins up to 25 kilodaltons by incorporating backbone chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and amide proton distances into the Rosetta protein structure modeling methodology. These data, which are too sparse for conventional methods, serve only to guide conformational search toward the lowest-energy conformations in the folding landscape; the details of the computed models are determined by the physical chemistry implicit in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. The new method is not hindered by the deuteration required to suppress nuclear relaxation processes for proteins greater than 15 kilodaltons and should enable routine NMR structure determination for larger proteins.

AB  - In a first systematic exploration of phasing with Rosetta de novo models, it is shown that all-atom refinement of coarse-grained models significantly improves both the model quality and performance in molecular replacement with the Phaser software., The prospect of phasing diffraction data sets ‘de novo’ for proteins with previously unseen folds is appealing but largely untested. In a first systematic exploration of phasing with Rosetta de novo models, it is shown that all-atom refinement of coarse-grained models significantly improves both the model quality and performance in molecular replacement with the Phaser software. 15 new cases of diffraction data sets that are unambiguously phased with de novo models are presented. These diffraction data sets represent nine space groups and span a large range of solvent contents (33–79%) and asymmetric unit copy numbers (1–4). No correlation is observed between the ease of phasing and the solvent content or asymmetric unit copy number. Instead, a weak correlation is found with the length of the modeled protein: larger proteins required somewhat less accurate models to give successful molecular replacement. Overall, the results of this survey suggest that de novo models can phase diffraction data for approximately one sixth of proteins with sizes of 100 residues or less. However, for many of these cases, ‘de novo phasing with de novo models’ requires significant investment of computational power, much greater than 103 CPU days per target. Improvements in conformational search methods will be necessary if molecular replacement with de novo models is to become a practical tool for targets without homology to previously solved protein structures.

AB  - Interleaved dimers and higher order symmetric oligomers are ubiquitous in biology but present a challenge to de novo structure prediction methodology: The structure adopted by a monomer can be stabilized largely by interactions with other monomers and hence not the lowest energy state of a single chain. Building on the Rosetta framework, we present a general method to simultaneously model the folding and docking of multiple-chain interleaved homo-oligomers. For more than a third of the cases in a benchmark set of interleaved homo-oligomers, the method generates near-native models of large α-helical bundles, interlocking β sandwiches, and interleaved α/β motifs with an accuracy high enough for molecular replacement based phasing. With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 Å rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta “fold-and-dock” protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with near-atomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.

TI  - Computation of Conformational Coupling in Allosteric Proteins

T2  - PLoS Computational Biology
AB  - In allosteric regulation, an effector molecule binding a protein at one site induces conformational changes, which alter structure and function at a distant active site. Two key challenges in the computational modeling of allostery are the prediction of the structure of one allosteric state starting from the structure of the other, and elucidating the mechanisms underlying the conformational coupling of the effector and active sites. Here we approach these two challenges using the Rosetta high-resolution structure prediction methodology. We find that the method can recapitulate the relaxation of effector-bound forms of single domain allosteric proteins into the corresponding ligand-free states, particularly when sampling is focused on regions known to change conformation most significantly. Analysis of the coupling between contacting pairs of residues in large ensembles of conformations spread throughout the landscape between and around the two allosteric states suggests that the transitions are built up from blocks of tightly coupled interacting sets of residues that are more loosely coupled to one another., A common means of biological regulation is allostery, in which an effector molecule binds to one site on a protein and induces a conformational change which changes activity at a distant active site. Frequently high resolution structures are determined for one state of an allosteric protein but not the other. To probe the allosteric conformational changes in such cases, we describe a computational method for predicting the structure of one allosteric state of a protein starting with knowledge of another. Our method also provides a detailed map of the free energy landscape traversed in an allosteric transition and reveals the coupling between interacting residue pairs that underlies the transition.

AB  - Protein NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to local structure. A robust protocol is described that exploits this relation for de novo protein structure generation, using as input experimental parameters the 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1Hα and 1HN NMR chemical shifts. These shifts are generally available at the early stage of the traditional NMR structure determination process, before the collection and analysis of structural restraints. The chemical shift based structure determination protocol uses an empirically optimized procedure to select protein fragments from the Protein Data Bank, in conjunction with the standard ROSETTA Monte Carlo assembly and relaxation methods. Evaluation of 16 proteins, varying in size from 56 to 129 residues, yielded full-atom models that have 0.7–1.8 Å root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms relative to the experimentally determined x-ray or NMR structures. The strategy also has been successfully applied in a blind manner to nine protein targets with molecular masses up to 15.4 kDa, whose conventional NMR structure determination was conducted in parallel by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. This protocol potentially provides a new direction for high-throughput NMR structure determination.

AB  - The biological behaviors of ribozymes, riboswitches, and numerous other functional RNA molecules are critically dependent on their tertiary folding and their ability to sample multiple functional states. The conformational heterogeneity and partially folded nature of most of these states has rendered their characterization by high-resolution structural approaches difficult or even intractable. Here we introduce a method to rapidly infer the tertiary helical arrangements of large RNA molecules in their native and non-native solution states. Multiplexed hydroxyl radical (·OH) cleavage analysis (MOHCA) enables the high-throughput detection of numerous pairs of contacting residues via random incorporation of radical cleavage agents followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We validated this technology by recapitulating the unfolded and native states of a well studied model RNA, the P4–P6 domain of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, at subhelical resolution. We then applied MOHCA to a recently discovered third state of the P4–P6 RNA that is stabilized by high concentrations of monovalent salt and whose partial order precludes conventional techniques for structure determination. The three-dimensional portrait of a compact, non-native RNA state reveals a well ordered subset of native tertiary contacts, in contrast to the dynamic but otherwise similar molten globule states of proteins. With its applicability to nearly any solution state, we expect MOHCA to be a powerful tool for illuminating the many functional structures of large RNA molecules and RNA/protein complexes.

TI  - Protein–Protein Docking with Backbone Flexibility
AU  - Wang, Chu

T2  - Journal of Molecular Biology
AB  - Computational protein–protein docking methods currently can create models with atomic accuracy for protein complexes provided that the conformational changes upon association are restricted to the side chains. However, it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking, and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. Here we present a reformulation of the Rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein–protein docking. The new method is based on a “fold-tree” representation of the molecular system, which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid-body degrees of freedom. Problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees. The explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near-native and incorrect models.

AB  - We describe predictions made using the Rosetta structure prediction methodology for both template-based modeling and free modeling categories in the Seventh Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. For the first time, aggressive sampling and all-atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the Rosetta@home distributed computing network. Template-based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. Free modeling methods gave near-atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. These results indicate that refinement with an all-atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions.

TI  - Automated de novo prediction of native-like RNA tertiary structures
AU  - Das, Rhiju
AU  - Baker, David
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - RNA tertiary structure prediction has been based almost entirely on base-pairing constraints derived from phylogenetic covariation analysis. We describe here a complementary approach, inspired by the Rosetta low-resolution protein structure prediction method, that seeks the lowest energy tertiary structure for a given RNA sequence without using evolutionary information. In a benchmark test of 20 RNA sequences with known structure and lengths of ≈30 nt, the new method reproduces better than 90% of Watson–Crick base pairs, comparable with the accuracy of secondary structure prediction methods. In more than half the cases, at least one of the top five models agrees with the native structure to better than 4 Å rmsd over the backbone. Most importantly, the method recapitulates more than one-third of non-Watson–Crick base pairs seen in the native structures. Tandem stacks of “sheared” base pairs, base triplets, and pseudoknots are among the noncanonical features reproduced in the models. In the cases in which none of the top five models were native-like, higher energy conformations similar to the native structures are still sampled frequently but not assigned low energies. These results suggest that modest improvements in the energy function, together with the incorporation of information from phylogenetic covariance, may allow confident and accurate structure prediction for larger and more complex RNA chains.

AB  - We have developed a method that combines the ROSETTA de novo protein folding and refinement protocol with distance constraints derived from homologous structures to build homology models that are frequently more accurate than their templates. We test this method by building complete-chain models for a benchmark set of 22 proteins, each with 1 or 2 candidate templates, for a total of 39 test cases. We use structure-based and sequence-based alignments for each of the test cases. All atoms, including hydrogens, are represented explicitly. The resulting models contain approximately the same number of atomic overlaps as experimentally determined crystal structures and maintain good stereochemistry. The most accurate models can be identified by their energies, and in 22 of 39 cases a model that is more accurate than the template over aligned regions is one of the 10 lowest-energy models.

AB  - The Robetta server and revised automatic protocols were used to predict structures for CASP6 targets. Robetta is a publicly available protein structure prediction server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/ that uses the Rosetta de novo and homology modeling structure prediction methods. We incorporated some of the lessons learned in the CASP5 experiment into the server prior to participating in CASP6. We additionally tested new ideas that were amenable to full-automation with an eye toward improving the server. We find that the Robetta server shows the greatest promise for the more challenging targets. The most significant finding from CASP5, that automated protocols can be roughly comparable in ability with the better human-intervention predictors, is repeated here in CASP6.

AB  - Anthrax toxin is made up of three proteins: the edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF) enzymes, and the multifunctional protective antigen (PA). Proteolytically activated PA heptamerizes, binds the EF/LF enzymes, and forms a pore that allows for EF/LF passage into host cells. Using directed mutagenesis, we identified three LF-PA contact points defined by a specific disulfide crosslink and two pairs of complementary charge-reversal mutations. These contact points were consistent with the lowest energy LF-PA complex found by using Rosetta protein-protein docking. These results illustrate how biochemical and computational methods can be combined to produce reliable models of large complexes. The model shows that EF and LF bind through a highly electrostatic interface, with their flexible N-terminal region positioned at the entrance of the heptameric PA pore and thus poised to initiate translocation in an N- to C-terminal direction.

AB  - We describe the adaptation of the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures. The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between 51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation <4 A from the native structure.

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
AB  - Voltage-gated ion channels control generation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells. Significant progress has been made in understanding structure and function of the voltage-gated ion channels, highlighted by the high-resolution open-state structure of the voltage-gated potassium channel, K(v)1.2. However, because the structure of the closed state is unknown, the gating mechanism remains controversial. We adapted the rosetta membrane method to model the structures of the K(v)1.2 and KvAP channels using homology, de novo, and domain assembly methods and selected the most plausible models using a limited number of experimental constraints. Our model of K(v)1.2 in the open state is very similar in overall topology to the x-ray structure of this channel. Modeling of KvAP in the open state suggests that orientation of the voltage-sensing domain relative to the pore-forming domain is considerably different from the orientation in the K(v)1.2 open state and that the magnitude of the vertical movement of S4 is significantly greater. Structural modeling of closed state of K(v)1.2 suggests gating movement that can be viewed as a sum of two previously suggested mechanisms: translation (2-4 A) plus rotation ( approximately 180 degrees ) of the S4 segment as proposed in the original "sliding helix" or "helical screw" models coupled with a rolling motion of the S1-S3 segments around S4, similar to recent "transporter" models of gating. We propose a unified mechanism of voltage-dependent gating for K(v)1.2 and KvAP in which this major conformational change moves the gating charge across the electric field in an analogous way for both channels.

The method recapitulates, often with very high accuracy, the structures of existing multidomain proteins.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the best-studied model organisms, yet the three-dimensional structure and molecular function of many yeast proteins remain unknown. Yeast proteins were parsed into 14,934 domains, and those lacking sequence similarity to proteins of known structure were folded using the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method on the World Community Grid. This structural data was integrated with process, component, and function annotations from the Saccharomyces Genome Database to assign yeast protein domains to SCOP superfamilies using a simple Bayesian approach. We have predicted the structure of 3,338 putative domains and assigned SCOP superfamily annotations to 581 of them. We have also assigned structural annotations to 7,094 predicted domains based on fold recognition and homology modeling methods. The domain predictions and structural information are available in an online database at http://rd.plos.org/10.1371_journal.pbio.0050076_01.

AB  - The creation of enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.

AB  - Targeting the interaction between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a promising therapeutic strategy. We designed inhibitors using two de novo design approaches. Computer-generated scaffolds were either built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) or docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes, and their amino acid sequences were designed to optimize target binding, folding, and stability. Ten designs bound the RBD, with affinities ranging from 100 picomolar to 10 nanomolar, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 24 picomolar and 35 nanomolar. The most potent, with new binding modes, are 56- and 64-residue proteins (IC50 ~ 0.16 nanograms per milliliter). Cryo–electron microscopy structures of these minibinders in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer with all three RBDs bound are nearly identical to the computational models. These hyperstable minibinders provide starting points for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

AB  - This manuscript presents the assessment of the template-based modeling category of the seventh Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7). The accuracy of predicted protein models for 108 target domains was assessed based on a detailed comparison between the experimental and predicted structures. The assessment was performed using numerical measures for backbone and structural alignment accuracy, and by scoring correctly modeled hydrogen bond interactions in the predictions. Based on these criteria, our statistical analysis identified a number of groups whose predictions were on average significantly more accurate. Furthermore, the predictions for six target proteins were evaluated for the accuracy of their modeled cofactor binding sites. We also assessed the ability of predictors to improve over the best available single template structure, which showed that the best groups produced models closer to the target structure than the best single template for a significant number of targets. In addition, we assessed the accuracy of the error estimates (local confidence values) assigned to predictions on a per residue basis. Finally, we discuss some general conclusions about the state of the art of template-based modeling methods and their usefulness for practical applications. Proteins 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - In CASP7, protein structure prediction targets that lacked substantial similarity to a protein in the PDB at the time of assessment were considered to be free modeling targets (FM). We assessed predictions for 14 FM targets as well as four other targets that were deemed to be on the borderline between FM targets and template based modeling targets (TBM/FM). GDT_TS was used as one measure of model quality. Model quality was also assessed by visual inspection. Visual inspection was performed by three independent assessors who were blinded to GDT_TS scores and other quantitative measures of model quality. The best models by visual inspection tended to rank among the top few percent by GDT_TS, but were typically not the highest scoring models. Thus, visual inspection remains an essential component of assessment for FM targets. Overall, group TS020 (Baker) performed best, but success on individual targets was widely distributed among many groups. Among these other groups, TS024 and TS025 (Zhang and Zhang server) performed notably well without exceptionally large computing resources. This should be considered encouraging for future CASPs. There was a sense of progress in template FM relative to CASP6, but we were unable to demonstrate this progress objectively. Proteins 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Based on the crystal structure of the cross-β spine formed by the peptide NNQQNY, we have developed a computational approach for identifying those segments of amyloidogenic proteins that themselves can form amyloid-like fibrils. The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed β-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using rosettadesign, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of ≈80% with a P value of ≈10−12 when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research.

T2  - Protein Science
AB  - Success in high-resolution protein–protein docking requires accurate modeling of side-chain conformations at the interface. Most current methods either leave side chains fixed in the conformations observed in the unbound protein structures or allow the side chains to sample a set of discrete rotamer conformations. Here we describe a rapid and efficient method for sampling off-rotamer side-chain conformations by torsion space minimization during protein–protein docking starting from discrete rotamer libraries supplemented with side-chain conformations taken from the unbound structures, and show that the new method improves side-chain modeling and increases the energetic discrimination between good and bad models. Analysis of the distribution of side-chain interaction energies within and between the two protein partners shows that the new method leads to more native-like distributions of interaction energies and that the neglect of side-chain entropy produces a small but measurable increase in the number of residues whose interaction energy cannot compensate for the entropic cost of side-chain freezing at the interface. The power of the method is highlighted by a number of predictions of unprecedented accuracy in the recent CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) blind test of protein–protein docking methods.

AB  - RosettaDock uses real-space Monte Carlo minimization (MCM) on both rigid-body and side-chain degrees of freedom to identify the lowest free energy docked arrangement of 2 protein structures. An improved version of the method that uses gradient-based minimization for off-rotamer side-chain optimization and includes information from unbound structures was used to create predictions for Rounds 4 and 5 of CAPRI. First, large numbers of independent MCM trajectories were carried out and the lowest free energy docked configurations identified. Second, new trajectories were started from these lowest energy structures to thoroughly sample the surrounding conformation space, and the lowest energy configurations were submitted as predictions. For all cases in which there were no significant backbone conformational changes, a small number of very low-energy configurations were identified in the first, global search and subsequently found to be close to the center of the basin of attraction in the free energy landscape in the second, local search. Following the release of the experimental coordinates, it was found that the centers of these free energy minima were remarkably close to the native structures in not only the rigid-body orientation but also the detailed conformations of the side-chains. Out of 8 targets, the lowest energy models had interface root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) less than 1.1 Å from the correct structures for 6 targets, and interface RMSDs less than 0.4 Å for 3 targets. The predictions were top submissions to CAPRI for Targets 11, 12, 14, 15, and 19. The close correspondence of the lowest free energy structures found in our searches to the experimental structures suggests that our free energy function is a reasonable representation of the physical chemistry, and that the real space search with full side-chain flexibility to some extent solves the protein–protein docking problem in the absence of significant backbone conformational changes. On the other hand, the approach fails when there are significant backbone conformational changes as the steric complementarity of the 2 proteins cannot be modeled without incorporating backbone flexibility, and this is the major goal of our current work.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 expresses a heterodimeric Fc receptor, gE-gI, on the surfaces of virions and infected cells that binds the Fc region of host immunoglobulin G and is implicated in the cell-to-cell spread of virus. gE-gI binds immunoglobulin G at the basic pH of the cell surface and releases it at the acidic pH of lysosomes, consistent with a role in facilitating the degradation of antiviral antibodies. Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the gE ectodomain (CgE) as the minimal Fc-binding domain and present a 1.78-Å CgE structure. A 5-Å gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independently verified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the CH2-CH3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins. The structure identifies interface histidines that may confer pH-dependent binding and regions of CgE implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus. The ternary organization of the gE-gI/Fc complex is compatible with antibody bipolar bridging, which can interfere with the antiviral immune response.

AB  - Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are ‘selfish’ genetic elements that combine the capability to selectively disrupt specific gene sequences with the ability to rapidly spread from a few individuals to an entire population through homologous recombination repair events. Because of these properties, HEGs are regarded as promising candidates to transfer genetic modifications from engineered laboratory mosquitoes to wild-type populations including Anopheles gambiae the vector of human malaria. Here we show that I-SceI and I-PpoI homing endonucleases cleave their recognition sites with high efficiency in A. gambiae cells and embryos and we demonstrate HEG-induced homologous and non-homologous repair events in a variety of functional assays. We also propose a gene drive system for mosquitoes that is based on our finding that I-PpoI cuts genomic rDNA located on the X chromosome in A. gambiae , which could be used to selectively incapacitate X-carrying spermatozoa thereby imposing a severe male-biased sex ratio.

AB  - Altering the specificity of DNA-cleaving enzymes could be useful in many medical or biotechnological applications, but it is quite a challenge in terms of computational protein design. Ashwell et al. have used computational redesign to alter the target-site specificity of the I-MsoI homing endonuclease, while maintaining wild-type binding affinity. The redesigned enzyme binds and cleaves the new DNA recognition site about 10,000 times more effectively than the wild-type enzyme, with target discrimination comparable to the original endonuclease. These results suggest that computational protein design methods can be used to create novel and highly specific endonucleases for gene therapy and other applications.

AB  - Escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, we developed multivalent protein-based minibinders as potential prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Homotrimers of single minibinders and fusions of three distinct minibinders were designed to geometrically match the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer architecture and were optimized by cell-free expression and found to exhibit virtually no measurable dissociation upon binding. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) showed that these trivalent minibinders engage all three receptor binding domains on a single S trimer. The top candidates neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with IC50 values in the low pM range, resist viral escape, and provide protection in highly vulnerable human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Our integrated workflow promises to accelerate the design of mutationally resilient therapeutics for pandemic preparedness.
One-Sentence Summary We designed, developed, and characterized potent, trivalent miniprotein binders that provide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

AB  - CAPRI Rounds 3, 4, and 5 are the first public test of the published RosettaDock algorithm. The targets cover a wide range of sizes and shapes. For most targets, published biological information indicated the region of the binding site on at least one docking partner. The RosettaDock algorithm produced high accuracy predictions for three targets, medium-accuracy predictions for two targets, and an acceptable prediction for one target. RosettaDock predicted all five targets with less than 450 residues to high or medium accuracy, but it predicted only one of seven targets with above 450 residues to acceptable accuracy. RosettaDock's high-accuracy predictions for small to moderately large targets reveal the predictive power and fidelity of the algorithm, especially the high-resolution refinement and scoring protocol. In addition, RosettaDock can predict complexes from at least one homology-modeled docking partner with comparable accuracy to unbound cases of similar size. Larger targets present a more intensive sampling problem, and some large targets present repulsive barriers to entering the binding site. Ongoing improvements to RosettaDock's low-resolution search may alleviate this problem. This first public test suggests that RosettaDock can be useful in a significant range of applications in biochemistry and cell biology. Proteins 2005;60:181–186. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This paper details the assessment process and evaluation results for the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7) domain prediction category. Domain predictions were assessed using the Normalized Domain Overlap score introduced in CASP6 and the accuracy of prediction of domain break points. The results of the analysis clearly demonstrate that the best methods are able to make consistently reliable predictions when the target has a structural template, although they are less good when the domain break occurs in a region not covered by a template. The conditions of the experiment meant that it was impossible to draw any conclusions about domain prediction for free modeling targets and it was also difficult to draw many distinctions between the best groups. Two thirds of the targets submitted were single domains and hence regarded as easy to predict. Even those targets defined as having multiple domains always had at least one domain with a similar template structure. Proteins 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We describe CASP11 de novo blind structure predictions made using the Rosetta structure prediction methodology with both automatic and human assisted protocols. Model accuracy was generally improved using coevolution derived residue–residue contact information as restraints during Rosetta conformational sampling and refinement, particularly when the number of sequences in the family was more than three times the length of the protein. The highlight was the human assisted prediction of T0806, a large and topologically complex target with no homologs of known structure, which had unprecedented accuracy—<3.0 Å root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the crystal structure over 223 residues. For this target, we increased the amount of conformational sampling over our fully automated method by employing an iterative hybridization protocol. Our results clearly demonstrate, in a blind prediction scenario, that coevolution derived contacts can considerably increase the accuracy of template-free structure modeling.

T2  - Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics
AB  - The prediction of changes in protein stability and structure resulting from single amino acid substitutions is both a fundamental test of macromolecular modeling methodology and an important current problem as high throughput sequencing reveals sequence polymorphisms at an increasing rate. In principle, given the structure of a wild-type protein and a point mutation whose effects are to be predicted, an accurate method should recapitulate both the structural changes and the change in the folding-free energy. Here, we explore the performance of protocols which sample an increasing diversity of conformations. We find that surprisingly similar performances in predicting changes in stability are achieved using protocols that involve very different amounts of conformational sampling, provided that the resolution of the force field is matched to the resolution of the sampling method. Methods involving backbone sampling can in some cases closely recapitulate the structural changes accompanying mutations but not surprisingly tend to do more harm than good in cases where structural changes are negligible. Analysis of the outliers in the stability change calculations suggests areas needing particular improvement; these include the balance between desolvation and the formation of favorable buried polar interactions, and unfolded state modeling.

AB  - Naturally occurring homooligomeric protein complexes exhibit striking internal symmetry. The evolutionary origins of this symmetry have been the subject of considerable speculation; proposals for the advantages associated with symmetry include greater folding efficiency, reduced aggregation, amenability to allosteric regulation, and greater adaptability. An alternative possibility stems from the idea that to contribute to fitness, and hence be subject to evolutionary optimization, a complex must be significantly populated, which implies that the interaction energy between monomers in the ancestors of modern-day complexes must have been sufficient to at least partially overcome the entropic cost of association. Here, we investigate the effects of this bias toward very-low-energy complexes on the distribution of symmetry in primordial homooligomers modeled as randomly interacting pairs of monomers. We demonstrate quantitatively that a bias toward very-low-energy complexes can result in the emergence of symmetry from random ensembles in which the overall frequency of symmetric complexes is vanishingly small. This result is corroborated by using explicit protein–protein docking calculations to generate ensembles of randomly docked complexes: the fraction of these that are symmetric increases from 0.02% in the overall population to >50% in very low energy subpopulations.

AB  - Repeat proteins have considerable potential for use as modular binding reagents or biomaterials in biomedical and nanotechnology applications. Here we describe a general computational method for building idealized repeats that integrates available family sequences and structural information with Rosetta de novo protein design calculations. Idealized designs from six different repeat families were generated and experimentally characterized; 80% of the proteins were expressed and soluble and more than 40% were folded and monomeric with high thermal stability. Crystal structures determined for members of three families are within 1Å root-mean-square deviation to the design models. The method provides a general approach for fast and reliable generation of stable modular repeat protein scaffolds.

AB  - We report crystal structures of a negatively selected T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes two I-Au-restricted myelin basic protein peptides and one of its peptide/major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligands. Unusual complementarity-determining region (CDR) structural features revealed by our analyses identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the highly variable CDR3 regions define ligand specificity. In addition to the pMHC contact residues contributed by CDR3, the CDR3 residues buried deep within the Vα/Vβ interface exert indirect effects on recognition by influencing the Vα/Vβ interdomain angle. This phenomenon represents an additional mechanism for increasing the potential diversity of the TCR repertoire. Both the direct and indirect effects exerted by CDR residues can impact global TCR/MHC docking. Analysis of the available TCR structures in light of these results highlights the significance of the Vα/Vβ interdomain angle in determining specificity and indicates that TCR/pMHC interface features do not distinguish autoimmune from non-autoimmune class II-restricted TCRs.

AB  - Efforts in structural biology have targeted the systematic determination of all protein structures through experimental determination or modeling. In recent years, 3-D electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) has assumed an increasingly important role in determining the structures of these large macromolecular assemblies to intermediate resolutions (6–10 Å). While these structures provide a snapshot of the assembly and its components in well-defined functional states, the resolution limits the ability to build accurate structural models. In contrast, sequence-based modeling techniques are capable of producing relatively robust structural models for isolated proteins or domains. In this work, we developed and applied a hybrid modeling approach, utilizing cryoEM density and ab initio modeling to produce a structural model for the core domain of a herpesvirus structural protein, VP26. Specifically, this method, first tested on simulated data, utilizes the cryoEM density map as a geometrical constraint in identifying the most native-like models from a gallery of models generated by ab initio modeling. The resulting model for the core domain of VP26, based on the 8.5-Å resolution herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) capsid cryoEM structure and mutational data, exhibited a novel fold. Additionally, the core domain of VP26 appeared to have a complementary interface to the known upper-domain structure of VP5, its cognate binding partner. While this new model provides for a better understanding of the assembly and interactions of VP26 in HSV-1, the approach itself may have broader applications in modeling the components of large macromolecular assemblies.

AB  - Conventional NMR structure determination requires nearly complete assignment of the cross peaks of a refined NOESY peak list. Depending on the size of the protein and quality of the spectral data, this can be a time-consuming manual process requiring several rounds of peak list refinement and structure determination. Programs such as Aria, CYANA, and AutoStructure can generate models using unassigned NOESY data but are very sensitive to the quality of the input peak lists and can converge to inaccurate structures if the signal-to-noise of the peak lists is low. Here, we show that models with high accuracy and reliability can be produced by combining the strengths of the high-resolution structure prediction program Rosetta with global measures of the agreement between structure models and experimental data. A first round of models generated using CS-Rosetta (Rosetta supplemented with backbone chemical shift information) are filtered on the basis of their goodness-of-fit with unassigned NOESY peak lists using the DP-score, and the best fitting models are subjected to high resolution refinement with the Rosetta rebuild-and-refine protocol. This hybrid approach uses both local backbone chemical shift and the unassigned NOESY data to direct Rosetta trajectories toward the native structure and produces more accurate models than AutoStructure/CYANA or CS-Rosetta alone, particularly when using raw unedited NOESY peak lists. We also show that when accurate manually refined NOESY peak lists are available, Rosetta refinement can consistently increase the accuracy of models generated using CYANA and AutoStructure.

AB  - The computational design of transmembrane proteins with more than one membrane-spanning region remains a major challenge. We report the design of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the designed dimer and tetramer—a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane helices—are very close to the design models. Our results pave the way for the design of multispan membrane proteins with new functions.

AB  - Naturally occurring, pharmacologically active peptides constrained with covalent crosslinks generally have shapes that have evolved to fit precisely into binding pockets on their targets. Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18–47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and/or N–C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.

AB  - The self-assembly of proteins into highly ordered nanoscale architectures is a hallmark of biological systems. The sophisticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models. The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two-component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications.

AB  - Nature provides many examples of self- and co-assembling protein-based molecular machines, including icosahedral protein cages that serve as scaffolds, enzymes, and compartments for essential biochemical reactions and icosahedral virus capsids, which encapsidate and protect viral genomes and mediate entry into host cells. Inspired by these natural materials, we report the computational design and experimental characterization of co-assembling, two-component, 120-subunit icosahedral protein nanostructures with molecular weights (1.8 to 2.8 megadaltons) and dimensions (24 to 40 nanometers in diameter) comparable to those of small viral capsids. Electron microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering, and x-ray crystallography show that 10 designs spanning three distinct icosahedral architectures form materials closely matching the design models. In vitro assembly of icosahedral complexes from independently purified components occurs rapidly, at rates comparable to those of viral capsids, and enables controlled packaging of molecular cargo through charge complementarity. The ability to design megadalton-scale materials with atomic-level accuracy and controllable assembly opens the door to a new generation of genetically programmable protein-based molecular machines.

AB  - One of the key challenges in computational biology is prediction of three-dimensional protein structures from amino-acid sequences. For most proteins, the “native state” lies at the bottom of a free-energy landscape. Protein structure prediction involves varying the degrees of freedom of the protein in a constrained manner until it approaches its native state. In the Rosetta protein structure prediction protocols, a large number of independent folding trajectories are simulated, and several lowest-energy results are likely to be close to the native state. The availability of hundred-teraflop, and shortly, petaflop, computing resources is revolutionizing the approaches available for protein structure prediction. Here, we discuss issues involved in utilizing such machines efficiently with the Rosetta code, including an overview of recent results of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction 7 (CASP7) in which the computationally demanding structure-refinement process was run on 16 racks of the IBM Blue Gene/L™ system at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. We highlight recent advances in high-performance computing and discuss future development paths that make use of the next-generation petascale (>1012 floating-point operations per second) machines.

AB  - Advances in our understanding of macromolecular structure come from experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, and also computational analysis of the growing number of atomic models obtained from such experiments. The later analyses have made it possible to develop powerful tools for structure prediction and optimization in the absence of experimental data. In recent years, a synergy between these computational methods for crystallographic structure determination and structure prediction and optimization has begun to be exploited. We review some of the advances in the algorithms used for crystallographic structure determination in the Phenix and Crystallography & NMR System software packages and describe how methods from ab initio structure prediction and refinement in Rosetta have been applied to challenging crystallographic problems. The prospects for future improvement of these methods are discussed.

AB  - Altering the specificity of an enzyme requires precise positioning of side-chain functional groups that interact with the modified groups of the new substrate. This requires not only sequence changes that introduce the new functional groups but also sequence changes that remodel the structure of the protein backbone so that the functional groups are properly positioned. We describe a computational design method for introducing specific enzyme–substrate interactions by directed remodeling of loops near the active site. Benchmark tests on 8 native protein–ligand complexes show that the method can recover native loop lengths and, often, native loop conformations. We then use the method to redesign a critical loop in human guanine deaminase such that a key side-chain interaction is made with the substrate ammelide. The redesigned enzyme is 100-fold more active on ammelide and 2.5e4-fold less active on guanine than wild-type enzyme: The net change in specificity is 2.5e6-fold. The structure of the designed protein was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis: The remodeled loop adopts a conformation that is within 1-Å Cα RMSD of the computational model.

AB  - What conformations do protein molecules populate in solution? Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while NMR describes structure in solution but using less data. NMR structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all <2.5 Å CαRMSD from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more NMR-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or NMR structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function.

AU  - Ashworth, Justin

T2  - Nucleic Acids Research
AB  - The biological functions of DNA-binding proteins often require that they interact with their targets with high affinity and/or high specificity. Here, we describe a computational method that estimates the extent of optimization for affinity and specificity of amino acids at a protein–DNA interface based on the crystal structure of the complex, by modeling the changes in binding-free energy associated with all individual amino acid and base substitutions at the interface. The extent to which residues are predicted to be optimal for specificity versus affinity varies within a given protein–DNA interface and between different complexes, and in many cases recapitulates previous experimental observations. The approach provides a complement to traditional methods of mutational analysis, and should be useful for rapidly formulating hypotheses about the roles of amino acid residues in protein–DNA interfaces.

AB  - Many naturally occurring protein systems function primarily as symmetric assemblies. Prediction of the quaternary structure of these assemblies is an important biological problem. This article describes automated tools we have developed for predicting the structures of symmetric protein assemblies in the Robetta structure prediction server. We assess the performance of this pipeline on a set of targets from the recent CASP12/CAPRI blind quaternary structure prediction experiment. Our approach successfully predicted 5 of 7 symmetric assemblies in this challenge, and was assessed as the best participating server group, and 1 of only 2 groups (human or server) with 2 predictions judged as high quality by the assessors. We also assess the method on a broader set of 22 natively symmetric CASP12 targets, where we show that oligomeric modeling can improve the accuracy of monomeric structure determination, particularly in highly intertwined oligomers.

AB  - Many scientific disciplines rely on computational methods for data analysis, model generation, and prediction. Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community. The practices described here are independent of subject area and can be readily adopted by other software development communities.

AB  - It is difficult to properly validate algorithms that dock a small molecule ligand into its protein receptor using data from the public domain: the predictions are not blind because the correct binding mode is already known, and public test cases may not be representative of compounds of interest such as drug leads. Here, we use private data from a real drug discovery program to carry out a blind evaluation of the RosettaLigand docking methodology and find that its performance is on average comparable with that of the best commercially available current small molecule docking programs. The strength of RosettaLigand is the use of the Rosetta sampling methodology to simultaneously optimize protein sidechain, protein backbone and ligand degrees of freedom; the extensive benchmark test described here identifies shortcomings in other aspects of the protocol and suggests clear routes to improving the method.

AB  - The binding interface of calmodulin and a calmodulin binding peptide were reengineered by computationally designing complementary bumps and holes. This redesign led to the development of sensitive and specific pairs of mutant proteins used to sense Ca2+ in a second generation of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (cameleons). These cameleons are no longer perturbed by large excesses of native calmodulin, and they display Ca2+ sensitivities tuned over a 100-fold range (0.6–160 μM). Incorporation of circularly permuted Venus in place of Citrine results in a 3- to 5-fold increase in the dynamic range. These redesigned cameleons show significant improvements over previous versions in the ability to monitor Ca2+ in the cytoplasm as well as distinct subcellular localizations, such as the plasma membrane of neurons and the mitochondria.

Contact prediction was assessed with standard measures well known in the field and the performance of specialist groups was evaluated alongside groups that submitted models with 3D coordinates. The evaluation was mainly focused on long range contact predictions for the set of new fold targets, although we analyzed predictions for all targets. Three groups with similar levels of accuracy and coverage performed a little better than the others. Comparisons of the predictions of the three best methods with those of CASP5/CAFASP3 suggested some improvement, although there were not enough targets in the comparisons to make this statistically significant.

AB  - A series of enzymes for Kemp elimination of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole has been recently designed and tested. In conjunction with the design process, extensive computational analyses were carried out to evaluate the potential performance of four of the designs, as presented here. The enzyme-catalyzed reactions were modeled using mixed quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations in the context of Monte Carlo (MC) statistical mechanics simulations. Free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations were used to characterize the free-energy surfaces for the catalyzed reactions as well as for reference processes in water. The simulations yielded detailed information about the catalytic mechanisms, activation barriers, and structural evolution of the active sites over the course of the reactions. The catalytic mechanism for the designed enzymes KE07, KE10(V131N), and KE15 was found to be concerted with proton transfer, generally more advanced in the transition state than breaking of the isoxazolyl N−O bond. On the basis of the free-energy results, all three enzymes were anticipated to be active. Ideas for further improvement of the enzyme designs also emerged. On the technical side, the synergy of parallel QM/MM and experimental efforts in the design of artificial enzymes is well illustrated.

AB  - Protein tyrosine kinases are critical cell signaling enzymes. These enzymes have a highly conserved Arg residue in their catalytic loop which is present two residues or four residues downstream from an absolutely conserved Asp catalytic base. Prior studies on protein tyrosine kinases Csk and Src revealed the potential for chemical rescue of catalytically deficient mutant kinases (Arg to Ala mutations) by small diamino compounds, particularly imidazole; however, the potency and efficiency of rescue was greater for Src. This current study further examines the structural and kinetic basis of rescue for mutant Src as compared to mutant Abl tyrosine kinase. An X-ray crystal structure of R388A Src revealed the surprising finding that a histidine residue of the N-terminus of a symmetry-related kinase inserts into the active site of the adjacent Src and mimics the hydrogen-bonding pattern seen in wild-type protein tyrosine kinases. Abl R367A shows potent and efficient rescue more comparable to Src, even though its catalytic loop is more like that of Csk. Various enzyme redesigns of the active sites indicate that the degree and specificity of rescue are somewhat flexible, but the overall properties of the enzymes and rescue agents play an overarching role. The newly discovered rescue agent 2-aminoimidazole is about as efficient as imidazole in rescuing R/A Src and Abl. Rate vs pH studies with these imidazole analogues suggest that the protonated imidazolium is the preferred form for chemical rescue, consistent with structural models. The efficient rescue seen with mutant Abl points to the potential of this approach to be used effectively to analyze Abl phosphorylation pathways in cells.

AB  - Homing endonucleases (HEs) cleave long (∼20 bp) DNA target sites with high site specificity to catalyze the lateral transfer of parasitic DNA elements. In order to determine whether comprehensive computational design could be used as a general strategy to engineer new HE target site specificities, we used RosettaDesign (RD) to generate 3200 different variants of the mCreI LAGLIDADG HE towards 16 different base pair positions in the 22 bp mCreI target site. Experimental verification of a range of these designs demonstrated that over 2/3 (24 of 35 designs, 69%) had the intended new site specificity, and that 14 of the 15 attempted specificity shifts (93%) were achieved. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using structure-based computational design to engineer HE variants with novel target site specificities to facilitate genome engineering.

AB  - Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with l-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of l- and d-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.

AB  - The redesign of protein−protein interactions is a stringent test of our understanding of molecular recognition and specificity. Previously we engineered a modest specificity switch into the colicin E7 DNase−Im7 immunity protein complex by identifying mutations that are disruptive in the native complex, but can be compensated by mutations on the interacting partner. Here we extend the approach by systematically sampling alternate rigid body orientations to optimize the interactions in a binding mode specific manner. Using this protocol we designed a de novo hydrogen bond network at the DNase−immunity protein interface and confirmed the design with X-ray crystallographic analysis. Subsequent design of the second shell of interactions guided by insights from the crystal structure on tightly bound water molecules, conformational strain, and packing defects yielded new binding partners that exhibited specificities of at least 300-fold between the cognate and the non-cognate complexes. This multi-step approach should be applicable to the design of polar protein−protein interactions and contribute to the re-engineering of regulatory networks mediated by protein−protein interactions.

AB  - Computational design provides the opportunity to program protein–protein interactions for desired applications. We used de novo protein interface design to generate a pH-dependent Fc domain binding protein that buries immunoglobulin G (IgG) His-433. Using next-generation sequencing of naïve and selected pools of a library of design variants, we generated a molecular footprint of the designed binding surface, confirming the binding mode and guiding further optimization of the balance between affinity and pH sensitivity. In biolayer interferometry experiments, the optimized design binds IgG with a Kd of ∼4 nM at pH 8.2, and approximately 500-fold more weakly at pH 5.5. The protein is extremely stable, heat-resistant and highly expressed in bacteria, and allows pH-based control of binding for IgG affinity purification and diagnostic devices.

AB  - The plasticity of naturally occurring protein structures, which can change shape considerably in response to changes in environmental conditions, is critical to biological function. While computational methods have been used for de novo design of proteins that fold to a single state with a deep free-energy minimum [P.-S. Huang, S. E. Boyken, D. Baker, Nature 537, 320–327 (2016)], and to reengineer natural proteins to alter their dynamics [J. A. Davey, A. M. Damry, N. K. Goto, R. A. Chica, Nat. Chem. Biol. 13, 1280–1285 (2017)] or fold [P. A. Alexander, Y. He, Y. Chen, J. Orban, P. N. Bryan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 21149–21154 (2009)], the de novo design of closely related sequences which adopt well-defined but structurally divergent structures remains an outstanding challenge. We designed closely related sequences (over 94% identity) that can adopt two very different homotrimeric helical bundle conformations—one short (∼66 Å height) and the other long (∼100 Å height)—reminiscent of the conformational transition of viral fusion proteins. Crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic characterization shows that both the short- and long-state sequences fold as designed. We sought to design bistable sequences for which both states are accessible, and obtained a single designed protein sequence that populates either the short state or the long state depending on the measurement conditions. The design of sequences which are poised to adopt two very different conformations sets the stage for creating large-scale conformational switches between structurally divergent forms.

AB  - Computational grafting of functional motifs onto scaffold proteins is a promising way to engineer novel proteins with pre-specified functionalities. Typically, protein grafting involves the transplantation of protein side chains from a functional motif onto structurally homologous regions of scaffold proteins. Using this approach, we previously transplanted the human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes onto heterologous proteins to design novel “epitope-scaffold” antigens. However, side-chain grafting is limited by the availability of scaffolds with compatible backbone for a given epitope structure and offers no route to modify backbone structure to improve mimicry or binding affinity. To address this, we report here a new and more aggressive computational method—backbone grafting of linear motifs—that transplants the backbone and side chains of linear functional motifs onto scaffold proteins. To test this method, we first used side-chain grafting to design new 2F5 epitope scaffolds with improved biophysical characteristics. We then independently transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto three of the same parent scaffolds using the newly developed backbone grafting procedure. Crystal structures of side-chain and backbone grafting designs showed close agreement with both the computational models and the desired epitope structure. In two cases, backbone grafting scaffolds bound antibody 2F5 with 30- and 9-fold higher affinity than corresponding side-chain grafting designs. These results demonstrate that flexible backbone methods for epitope grafting can significantly improve binding affinities over those achieved by fixed backbone methods alone. Backbone grafting of linear motifs is a general method to transplant functional motifs when backbone remodeling of the target scaffold is necessary.

AB  - Cyclic symmetry is frequent in protein and peptide homo-oligomers, but extremely rare within a single chain, as it is not compatible with free N- and C-termini. Here we describe the computational design of mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins. Crystal structures of three C2- and C3-symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2-symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally-designed models with backbone heavy-atom RMSD values of 1 Å or better. Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.

AB  - We describe a general computational method for designing proteins that self-assemble to a desired symmetric architecture. Protein building blocks are docked together symmetrically to identify complementary packing arrangements, and low-energy protein-protein interfaces are then designed between the building blocks in order to drive self-assembly. We used trimeric protein building blocks to design a 24-subunit, 13-nm diameter complex with octahedral symmetry and a 12-subunit, 11-nm diameter complex with tetrahedral symmetry. The designed proteins assembled to the desired oligomeric states in solution, and the crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the resulting materials closely match the design models. The method can be used to design a wide variety of self-assembling protein nanomaterials.

AB  - <p>Members of the Zrt and Irt protein (ZIP) family are a central participant in transition metal homeostasis as they function to increase the cytosolic concentration of zinc and/or iron. However, the lack of a crystal structure hinders elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ZIP proteins. Here, we employed GREMLIN, a co-evolution-based contact prediction approach in conjunction with the Rosetta structure prediction program to construct a structural model of the human (h) ZIP4 transporter. The predicted contact data are best fit by modeling hZIP4 as a dimer. Mutagenesis of residues that comprise a central putative hZIP4 transmembrane transition metal coordination site in the structural model alter the kinetics and specificity of hZIP4. Comparison of the hZIP4 dimer model to all known membrane protein structures identifies the 12-transmembrane monomeric <i>Piriformospora indica</i> phosphate transporter (PiPT), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), as a likely structural homolog.</p>

AB  - We describe a computationally designed enzyme, formolase (FLS), which catalyzes the carboligation of three one-carbon formaldehyde molecules into one three-carbon dihydroxyacetone molecule. The existence of FLS enables the design of a new carbon fixation pathway, the formolase pathway, consisting of a small number of thermodynamically favorable chemical transformations that convert formate into a three-carbon sugar in central metabolism. The formolase pathway is predicted to use carbon more efficiently and with less backward flux than any naturally occurring one-carbon assimilation pathway. When supplemented with enzymes carrying out the other steps in the pathway, FLS converts formate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and other central metabolites in vitro. These results demonstrate how modern protein engineering and design tools can facilitate the construction of a completely new biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - Site-specific homing endonucleases are capable of inducing gene conversion via homologous recombination. Reprogramming their cleavage specificities allows the targeting of specific biological sites for gene correction or conversion. We used computational protein design to alter the cleavage specificity of I-MsoI for three contiguous base pair substitutions, resulting in an endonuclease whose activity and specificity for its new site rival that of wild-type I-MsoI for the original site. Concerted design for all simultaneous substitutions was more successful than a modular approach against individual substitutions, highlighting the importance of context-dependent redesign and optimization of protein–DNA interactions. We then used computational design based on the crystal structure of the designed complex, which revealed significant unanticipated shifts in DNA conformation, to create an endonuclease that specifically cleaves a site with four contiguous base pair substitutions. Our results demonstrate that specificity switches for multiple concerted base pair substitutions can be computationally designed, and that iteration between design and structure determination provides a route to large scale reprogramming of specificity.

AB  - Thermostabilizing an enzyme while maintaining its activity for industrial or biomedical applications can be difficult with traditional selection methods. We describe a rapid computational approach that identified three mutations within a model enzyme that produced a 10°C increase in apparent melting temperature Tm and a 30-fold increase in half-life at 50°C, with no reduction in catalytic efficiency. The effects of the mutations were synergistic, giving an increase in excess of the sum of their individual effects. The redesigned enzyme induced an increased, temperature-dependent bacterial growth rate under conditions that required its activity, thereby coupling molecular and metabolic engineering.

AB  - The human proteome is rich with protein kinases, and this richness has made the kinase of crucial importance in initiating and maintaining cell behavior. Elucidating cell signaling networks and manipulating their components to understand and alter behavior require well designed inhibitors. These inhibitors are needed in culture to cause and study network perturbations, and the same compounds can be used as drugs to treat disease. Understanding the structural biology of protein kinases in detail, including their commonalities, differences and modes of substrate interaction, is necessary for designing high quality inhibitors that will be of true use for cell biology and disease therapy. To this end, we here report on a structural analysis of all available active-conformation protein kinases, discussing residue conservation, the novel features of such conservation, unique properties of atypical kinases and variability in the context of substrate binding. We also demonstrate how this information can be used for structure prediction. Our findings will be of use not only in understanding protein kinase function and evolution, but they highlight the flaws inherent in kinase drug design as commonly practiced and dictate an appropriate strategy for the sophisticated design of specific inhibitors for use in the laboratory and disease therapy.

AB  - The ability of proteins and other macromolecules to interact with inorganic surfaces is essential to biological function. The proteins involved in these interactions are highly charged and often rich in carboxylic acid side chains1–5, but the structures of most protein–inorganic interfaces are unknown. We explored the possibility of systematically designing structured protein–mineral interfaces, guided by the example of ice-binding proteins, which present arrays of threonine residues (matched to the ice lattice) that order clathrate waters into an ice-like structure6. Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54 carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration, individual molecules bind independently to mica in the designed orientations, whereas at high K+ concentration, the designs form two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the inherent structural bias in the muscovite lattice to produce protein arrays ordered over tens of millimetres. Incorporation of designed protein–protein interactions preserving the match between the proteins and the K+ lattice led to extended self-assembled structures on mica: designed end-to-end interactions produced micrometre-long single-protein-diameter wires and a designed trimeric interface yielded extensive honeycomb arrays. The nearest-neighbour distances in these hexagonal arrays could be set digitally between 7.5 and 15.9 nanometres with 2.1-nanometre selectivity by changing the number of repeat units in the monomer. These results demonstrate that protein–inorganic lattice interactions can be systematically programmed and set the stage for designing protein–inorganic hybrid materials.

AB  - Amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's and prion diseases, are each associated with unbranched protein fibrils. Each fibril is made of a particular protein, yet they share common properties. One such property is nucleation-dependent fibril growth. Monomers of amyloid-forming proteins can remain in dissolved form for long periods, before rapidly assembly into fibrils. The lag before growth has been attributed to slow kinetics of formation of a nucleus, on which other molecules can deposit to form the fibril. We have explored the energetics of fibril formation, based on the known molecular structure of a fibril-forming peptide from the yeast prion, Sup35, using both classical and quantum (density functional theory) methods. We find that the energetics of fibril formation for the first three layers are cooperative using both methods. This cooperativity is consistent with the observation that formation of amyloid fibrils involves slow nucleation and faster growth.

AB  - The regular arrangements of β-strands around a central axis in β-barrels and of α-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of α-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with β-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of β-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of β-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI, and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.

AB  - β-sheet proteins carry out critical functions in biology, and hence are attractive scaffolds for computational protein design. Despite this potential, de novo design of all-β-sheet proteins from first principles lags far behind the design of all-α or mixed-αβ domains owing to their non-local nature and the tendency of exposed β-strand edges to aggregate. Through study of loops connecting unpaired β-strands (β-arches), we have identified a series of structural relationships between loop geometry, side chain directionality and β-strand length that arise from hydrogen bonding and packing constraints on regular β-sheet structures. We use these rules to de novo design jellyroll structures with double-stranded β-helices formed by eight antiparallel β-strands. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a hyperthermostable design closely matched the computational model, demonstrating accurate control over the β-sheet structure and loop geometry. Our results open the door to the design of a broad range of non-local β-sheet protein structures.

AB  - Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.

AB  - In nature, structural specificity in DNA and proteins is encoded differently: In DNA, specificity arises from modular hydrogen bonds in the core of the double helix, whereas in proteins, specificity arises largely from buried hydrophobic packing complemented by irregular peripheral polar interactions. Here, we describe a general approach for designing a wide range of protein homo-oligomers with specificity determined by modular arrays of central hydrogen-bond networks. We use the approach to design dimers, trimers, and tetramers consisting of two concentric rings of helices, including previously not seen triangular, square, and supercoiled topologies. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structures overall, and the hydrogen-bond networks in particular, are nearly identical to the design models, and the networks confer interaction specificity in vivo. The ability to design extensive hydrogen-bond networks with atomic accuracy enables the programming of protein interaction specificity for a broad range of synthetic biology applications; more generally, our results demonstrate that, even with the tremendous diversity observed in nature, there are fundamentally new modes of interaction to be discovered in proteins.

AB  - We describe a general computational approach to designing self-assembling helical filaments from monomeric proteins and use this approach to design proteins that assemble into micrometer-scale filaments with a wide range of geometries in vivo and in vitro. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six designs are close to the computational design models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.

AB  - A systematic and robust approach to generating complex protein nanomaterials would have broad utility. We develop a hierarchical approach to designing multi-component protein assemblies from two classes of modular building blocks: designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) and helical bundle oligomers (HBs). We first rigidly fuse DHRs to HBs to generate a large library of oligomeric building blocks. We then generate assemblies with cyclic, dihedral, and point group symmetries from these building blocks using architecture guided rigid helical fusion with new software named WORMS. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy characterization show that the hierarchical design approach can accurately generate a wide range of assemblies, including a 43 nm diameter icosahedral nanocage. The computational methods and building block sets described here provide a very general route to de novo designed protein nanomaterials.

AB  - We have developed an approach for determining NMR structures of proteins over 20 kDa that utilizes sparse distance restraints obtained using transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy experiments on perdeuterated samples to guide RASREC Rosetta NMR structure calculations. The method was tested on 11 proteins ranging from 15 to 40 kDa, seven of which were previously unsolved. The RASREC Rosetta models were in good agreement with models obtained using traditional NMR methods with larger restraint sets. In five cases X-ray structures were determined or were available, allowing comparison of the accuracy of the Rosetta models and conventional NMR models. In all five cases, the Rosetta models were more similar to the X-ray structures over both the backbone and side-chain conformations than the “best effort” structures determined by conventional methods. The incorporation of sparse distance restraints into RASREC Rosetta allows routine determination of high-quality solution NMR structures for proteins up to 40 kDa, and should be broadly useful in structural biology.

AB  - Symmetric protein dimers, trimers, and higher-order cyclic oligomers play key roles in many biological processes. However, structural studies of oligomeric systems by solution NMR can be difficult due to slow tumbling of the system and the difficulty in identifying NOE interactions across protein interfaces. Here, we present an automated method (RosettaOligomers) for determining the solution structures of oligomeric systems using only chemical shifts, sparse NOEs, and domain orientation restraints from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) without a need for a previously determined structure of the monomeric subunit. The method integrates previously developed Rosetta protocols for solving the structures of monomeric proteins using sparse NMR data and for predicting the structures of both nonintertwined and intertwined symmetric oligomers. We illustrated the performance of the method using a benchmark set of nine protein dimers, one trimer, and one tetramer with available experimental data and various interface topologies. The final converged structures are found to be in good agreement with both experimental data and previously published high-resolution structures. The new approach is more readily applicable to large oligomeric systems than conventional structure-determination protocols, which often require a large number of NOEs, and will likely become increasingly relevant as more high-molecular weight systems are studied by NMR.

AB  - Perturbation in the Dystroglycan (Dg)?Dystrophin (Dys) complex results in muscular dystrophies and brain abnormalities in human. Here we report that Drosophila is an excellent genetically tractable model to study muscular dystrophies and neuronal abnormalities caused by defects in this complex. Using a fluorescence polarization assay, we show a high conservation in Dg?Dys interaction between human and Drosophila. Genetic and RNAi-induced perturbations of Dg and Dys in Drosophila cause cell polarity and muscular dystrophy phenotypes: decreased mobility, age-dependent muscle degeneration and defective photoreceptor path-finding. Dg and Dys are required in targeting glial cells and neurons for correct neuronal migration. Importantly, we now report that Dg interacts with insulin receptor and Nck/Dock SH2/SH3-adaptor molecule in photoreceptor path-finding. This is the first demonstration of a genetic interaction between Dg and InR.

AB  - All-atom sampling is a critical and compute-intensive end stage to protein structural modeling. Because of the vast size and extreme ruggedness of conformational space, even close to the native structure, the high-resolution sampling problem is almost as difficult as predicting the rough fold of a protein. Here, we present a combination of new algorithms that considerably speed up the exploration of very rugged conformational landscapes and are capable of finding heretofore hidden low-energy states. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical workflow and can be parallelized on supercomputers with up to 128,000 compute cores with near perfect efficiency. Such scaling behavior is notable, as with Moore's law continuing only in the number of cores per chip, parallelizability is a critical property of new algorithms. Using the enhanced sampling power, we have uncovered previously invisible deficiencies in the Rosetta force field and created an extensive decoy training set for optimizing and testing force fields. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The energy of α helix formation is well known to be highly cooperative, but the origin and relative importance of the contributions to helical cooperativity have been unclear. Here we separate the energy of helix formation into short range and long range components by using two series of helical dimers of variable length. In one dimer series two monomeric helices interact by forming hydrogen bonds, while in the other they are coupled only through long range, primarily electrostatic interactions. Using Density Functional Theory, we find that approximately half of the cooperativity of helix formation is due to electrostatic interactions between residues, while the other half is due to nonadditive many-body effects brought about by redistribution of electron density with helix length.

AB  - Elicitation of antibodies against targets that are immunorecessive, cryptic, or transient in their native context has been a challenge for vaccine design. Here we demonstrate the elicitation of structure-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 gp41 epitope of the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant “2F5-epitope scaffolds” possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p < 0.04), while antibody responses against the graft—as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions—resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation.

AB  - In 2008, a successful computational design procedure was reported that yielded active enzyme catalysts for the Kemp elimination. Here, we studied these proteins together with a set of previously unpublished inactive designs to determine the sources of activity or lack thereof, and to predict which of the designed structures are most likely to be catalytic. Methods that range from quantum mechanics (QM) on truncated model systems to the treatment of the full protein with ONIOM QM/MM and AMBER molecular dynamics (MD) were explored. The most effective procedure involved molecular dynamics, and a general MD protocol was established. Substantial deviations from the ideal catalytic geometries were observed for a number of designs. Penetration of water into the catalytic site and insufficient residue-packing around the active site are the main factors that can cause enzyme designs to be inactive. Where in the past, computational evaluations of designed enzymes were too time-extensive for practical considerations, it has now become feasible to rank and refine candidates computationally prior to and in conjunction with experimentation, thus markedly increasing the efficiency of the enzyme design process.

AB  - Colicin endonucleases (DNases) are bound and inactivated by immunity (Im) proteins. Im proteins are broadly cross-reactive yet specific inhibitors binding cognate and non-cognate DNases with Kd values that vary between 10−4 and 10−14 M, characteristics that are explained by a ‘dual-recognition’ mechanism. In this work, we addressed for the first time the energetics of Im protein recognition by colicin DNases through a combination of E9 DNase alanine scanning and double-mutant cycles (DMCs) coupled with kinetic and calorimetric analyses of cognate Im9 and non-cognate Im2 binding, as well as computational analysis of alanine scanning and DMC data. We show that differential ΔΔGs observed for four E9 DNase residues cumulatively distinguish cognate Im9 association from non-cognate Im2 association. E9 DNase Phe86 is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the centre of the interface, which is coordinated by conserved and variable hotspot residues of the cognate Im protein. Experimental DMC analysis reveals that only modest coupling energies to Im9 residues are observed, in agreement with calculated DMCs using the program ROSETTA and consistent with the largely hydrophobic nature of E9 DNase–Im9 specificity contacts. Computed values for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants showed reasonable agreement with experimental ΔΔG data, particularly for interactions not mediated by interfacial water molecules. ΔΔG predictions for residues that contact buried water molecules calculated using solvated rotamer models met with mixed success; however, we were able to predict with a high degree of accuracy the location and energetic contribution of one such contact. Our study highlights how colicin DNases are able to utilise both conserved and variable amino acids to distinguish cognate from non-cognate Im proteins, with the energetic contributions of the conserved residues modulated by neighbouring specificity sites.

AB  - Enzymes use substrate-binding energy to promote ground-state association and to selectively lower the energy of the reaction transition state. Thyme et al. have determined that for the monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI, which cleaves double-stranded DNA with high sequence specificity, mutation in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme is responsible for increasing certain kinetic parameters (KD and KM), whereas mutation in the C-terminal domain decreases another kinetic parameter (kcat). This unexpected asymmetry in the utilization of enzyme–substrate binding energy for catalysis may enable researchers to more effectively re-engineer endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other biomedical applications.

AB  - De novo protein structure prediction requires location of the lowest energy state of the polypeptide chain among a vast set of possible conformations. Powerful approaches include conformational space annealing, in which search progressively focuses on the most promising regions of conformational space, and genetic algorithms, in which features of the best conformations thus far identified are recombined. We describe a new approach that combines the strengths of these two approaches. Protein conformations are projected onto a discrete feature space which includes backbone torsion angles, secondary structure, and beta pairings. For each of these there is one “native” value: the one found in the native structure. We begin with a large number of conformations generated in independent Monte Carlo structure prediction trajectories from Rosetta. Native values for each feature are predicted from the frequencies of feature value occurrences and the energy distribution in conformations containing them. A second round of structure prediction trajectories are then guided by the predicted native feature distributions. We show that native features can be predicted at much higher than background rates, and that using the predicted feature distributions improves structure prediction in a benchmark of 28 proteins. The advantages of our approach are that features from many different input structures can be combined simultaneously without producing atomic clashes or otherwise physically inviable models, and that the features being recombined have a relatively high chance of being correct.

AB  - Statherin is an enamel pellicle protein that inhibits hydroxyapatite (HAP) nucleation and growth, lubricates the enamel surface, and is recognized by oral bacteria in periodontal diseases. We report here from solid-state NMR measurements that the protein's C-terminal region folds into an α-helix upon adsorption to HAP crystals. This region contains the binding sites for bacterial fimbriae that mediate bacterial cell adhesion to the surface of the tooth. The helical segment is shown through long-range distance measurements to fold back onto the intermediate region (residues Y16–P28) defining the global fold of the protein. Statherin, previously shown to be unstructured in solution, undergoes conformation selection on its substrate mineral surface. This surface-induced folding of statherin can be related to its functionality in inhibiting HAP crystal growth and can explain how oral pathogens selectively recognize HAP-bound statherin.

AB  - Determination of high-quality small protein structures by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods generally requires acquisition and analysis of an extensive set of structural constraints. The process generally demands extensive backbone and sidechain resonance assignments, and weeks or even months of data collection and interpretation. Here we demonstrate rapid and high-quality protein NMR structure generation using CS-Rosetta with a perdeuterated protein sample made at a significantly reduced cost using new bacterial culture condensation methods. Our strategy provides the basis for a high-throughput approach for routine, rapid, high-quality structure determination of small proteins. As an example, we demonstrate the determination of a high-quality 3D structure of a small 8 kDa protein, E. coli cold shock protein A (CspA), using <4 days of data collection and fully automated data analysis methods together with CS-Rosetta. The resulting CspA structure is highly converged and in excellent agreement with the published crystal structure, with a backbone RMSD value of 0.5 Å, an all atom RMSD value of 1.2 Å to the crystal structure for well-defined regions, and RMSD value of 1.1 Å to crystal structure for core, non-solvent exposed sidechain atoms. Cross validation of the structure with 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY data obtained with a perdeuterated 15N, 13C-enriched 13CH3 methyl protonated CspA sample confirms that essentially all of these independently-interpreted NOE-based constraints are already satisfied in each of the 10 CS-Rosetta structures. By these criteria, the CS-Rosetta structure generated by fully automated analysis of data for a perdeuterated sample provides an accurate structure of CspA. This represents a general approach for rapid, automated structure determination of small proteins by NMR.

AB  - Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.

AB  - The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) gp120 and gp41 mediate entry and are the targets for neutralizing antibodies. Within gp41, a continuous epitope defined by the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5, is one of the few conserved sites accessible to antibodies on the functional HIV Env spike. Recently, as an initial attempt at structure-guided design, we transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto several non-HIV acceptor scaffold proteins that we termed epitope scaffolds (ES). As immunogens, these ES proteins elicited antibodies with exquisite binding specificity matching that of the 2F5 antibody. These novel 2F5 epitope scaffolds presented us with the opportunity to test heterologous prime∶boost immunization strategies to selectively boost antibody responses against the engrafted gp41 2F5 epitope. Such strategies might be employed to target conserved but poorly immunogenic sites on the HIV-1 Env, and, more generally, other structurally defined pathogen targets. Here, we assessed ES prime∶boosting by measuring epitope specific serum antibody titers by ELISA and B cell responses by ELISpot analysis using both free 2F5 peptide and an unrelated ES protein as probes. We found that the heterologous ES prime∶boosting immunization regimen elicits cross-reactive humoral responses to the structurally constrained 2F5 epitope target, and that incorporating a promiscuous T cell helper epitope in the immunogens resulted in higher antibody titers against the 2F5 graft, but did not result in virus neutralization. Interestingly, two epitope scaffolds (ES1 and ES2), which did not elicit a detectable 2F5 epitope-specific response on their own, boosted such responses when primed with the ES5. Together, these results indicate that heterologous ES prime∶boost immunization regimens effectively focus the humoral immune response on the structurally defined and immunogen-conserved HIV-1 2F5 epitope.

AB  - We describe a procedure for designing proteins with backbones produced by varying the parameters in the Crick coiled coil–generating equations. Combinatorial design calculations identify low-energy sequences for alternative helix supercoil arrangements, and the helices in the lowest-energy arrangements are connected by loop building. We design an antiparallel monomeric untwisted three-helix bundle with 80-residue helices, an antiparallel monomeric right-handed four-helix bundle, and a pentameric parallel left-handed five-helix bundle. The designed proteins are extremely stable (extrapolated ΔGfold > 60 kilocalories per mole), and their crystal structures are close to those of the design models with nearly identical core packing between the helices. The approach enables the custom design of hyperstable proteins with fine-tuned geometries for a wide range of applications.

AB  - Recent efforts to design de novo or redesign the sequence and structure of proteins using computational techniques have met with significant success. Most, if not all, of these computational methodologies attempt to model atomic-level interactions, and hence high-resolution structural characterization of the designed proteins is critical for evaluating the atomic-level accuracy of the underlying design force-fields. We previously used our computational protein design protocol RosettaDesign to completely redesign the sequence of the activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase A2. With 68% of the wild-type sequence changed, the designed protein, AYEdesign, is over 10 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein. Here, we describe the high-resolution crystal structure and solution NMR structure of AYEdesign, which show that the experimentally determined backbone and side-chains conformations are effectively superimposable with the computational model at atomic resolution. To isolate the origins of the remarkable stabilization, we have designed and characterized a new series of procarboxypeptidase mutants that gain significant thermodynamic stability with a minimal number of mutations; one mutant gains more than 5 kcal/mol of stability over the wild-type protein with only four amino acid changes. We explore the relationship between force-field smoothing and conformational sampling by comparing the experimentally determined free energies of the overall design and these focused subsets of mutations to those predicted using modified force-fields, and both fixed and flexible backbone sampling protocols.

AU  - Chivian, Dylan

T2  - Nucleic Acids Research
AB  - The accuracy of a homology model based on the structure of a distant relative or other topologically equivalent protein is primarily limited by the quality of the alignment. Here we describe a systematic approach for sequence-to-structure alignment, called ‘K*Sync’, in which alignments are generated by dynamic programming using a scoring function that combines information on many protein features, including a novel measure of how obligate a sequence region is to the protein fold. By systematically varying the weights on the different features that contribute to the alignment score, we generate very large ensembles of diverse alignments, each optimal under a particular constellation of weights. We investigate a variety of approaches to select the best models from the ensemble, including consensus of the alignments, a hydrophobic burial measure, low- and high-resolution energy functions, and combinations of these evaluation methods. The effect on model quality and selection resulting from loop modeling and backbone optimization is also studied. The performance of the method on a benchmark set is reported and shows the approach to be effective at both generating and selecting accurate alignments. The method serves as the foundation of the homology modeling module in the Robetta server.

AU  - Bradley, Philip

T2  - Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics
AB  - Proteins with complex, nonlocal beta-sheets are challenging for de novo structure prediction, due in part to the difficulty of efficiently sampling long-range strand pairings. We present a new, multilevel approach to beta-sheet structure prediction that circumvents this difficulty by reformulating structure generation in terms of a folding tree. Nonlocal connections in this tree allow us to explicitly sample alternative beta-strand pairings while simultaneously exploring local conformational space using backbone torsion-space moves. An iterative, energy-biased resampling strategy is used to explore the space of beta-strand pairings; we expect that such a strategy will be generally useful for searching large conformational spaces with a high degree of combinatorial complexity.

AB  - With more than 60,000 structures now available in the Protein Data Bank, it is frequently possible to create homology-based models to help solve the X-ray crystal structure of a protein with an unknown three-dimensional structure. But current techniques usually fail when the protein of interest has less than 30% sequence identity to known structures. A new method able to overcome this limitation has been developed and used successfully in 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction datasets that could not be solved by conventional means. The new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for more than half the cases in which current methods fail, as long as resolution is 3.2 Å or better, with four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with more than 20% sequence identity.

AB  - The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the “ideality” of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.

AB  - The prediction of functional sites in newly solved protein structures is a challenge for computational structural biology. Most methods for approaching this problem use evolutionary conservation as the primary indicator of the location of functional sites. However, sequence conservation reflects not only evolutionary selection at functional sites to maintain protein function, but also selection throughout the protein to maintain the stability of the folded state. To disentangle sequence conservation due to protein functional constraints from sequence conservation due to protein structural constraints, we use all atom computational protein design methodology to predict sequence profiles expected under solely structural constraints, and to compute the free energy difference between the naturally occurring amino acid and the lowest free energy amino acid at each position. We show that functional sites are more likely than non-functional sites to have computed sequence profiles which differ significantly from the naturally occurring sequence profiles and to have residues with sub-optimal free energies, and that incorporation of these two measures improves sequence based prediction of protein functional sites. The combined sequence and structure based functional site prediction method has been implemented in a publicly available web server.

AB  - A correct alignment is an essential requirement in homology modeling. Yet in order to bridge the structural gap between template and target, which may not only involve loop rearrangements, but also shifts of secondary structure elements and repacking of core residues, high-resolution refinement methods with full atomic details are needed. Here, we describe four approaches that address this “last mile of the protein folding problem” and have performed well during CASP8, yielding physically realistic models: YASARA, which runs molecular dynamics simulations of models in explicit solvent, using a new partly knowledge-based all atom force field derived from Amber, whose parameters have been optimized to minimize the damage done to protein crystal structures. The LEE-SERVER, which makes extensive use of conformational space annealing to create alignments, to help Modeller build physically realistic models while satisfying input restraints from templates and CHARMM stereochemistry, and to remodel the side-chains. ROSETTA, whose high resolution refinement protocol combines a physically realistic all atom force field with Monte Carlo minimization to allow the large conformational space to be sampled quickly. And finally UNDERTAKER, which creates a pool of candidate models from various templates and then optimizes them with an adaptive genetic algorithm, using a primarily empirical cost function that does not include bond angle, bond length, or other physics-like terms.

AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an interspecies protein transport machine that plays a major role in interactions of Gram-negative bacteria with animals and plants by delivering bacterial effector proteins into host cells. T3SSs span both membranes of Gram-negative bacteria by forming a structure of connected oligomeric rings termed the needle complex (NC). Here, the localization of subunits in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium T3SS NC were probed via mass spectrometry-assisted identification of chemical cross-links in intact NC preparations. Cross-links between amino acids near the amino terminus of the outer membrane ring component InvG and the carboxyl terminus of the inner membrane ring component PrgH and between the two inner membrane components PrgH and PrgK allowed for spatial localization of the three ring components within the electron density map structures of NCs. Mutational and biochemical analysis demonstrated that the amino terminus of InvG and the carboxyl terminus of PrgH play a critical role in the assembly and function of the T3SS apparatus. Analysis of an InvG mutant indicates that the structure of the InvG oligomer can affect the switching of the T3SS substrate to translocon and effector components. This study provides insights into how structural organization of needle complex base components promotes T3SS assembly and function.
IMPORTANCE Many biological macromolecular complexes are composed of symmetrical homomers, which assemble into larger structures. Some complexes, such as secretion systems, span biological membranes, forming hydrophilic domains to move substrates across lipid bilayers. Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) deliver bacterial effector proteins directly to the host cell cytoplasm and allow for critical interactions between many Gram-negative pathogenic bacterial species and their hosts. Progress has been made towards the goal of determining the three-dimensional structure of the secretion apparatus by determination of high-resolution crystal structures of individual protein subunits and low-resolution models of the assembly, using reconstructions of cryoelectron microscopy images. However, a more refined picture of the localization of periplasmic ring structures within the assembly and their interactions has only recently begun to emerge. This work localizes T3SS transmembrane rings and identifies structural elements that affect substrate switching and are essential to the assembly of components that are inserted into host cell membranes.

AB  - The design of new enzymes for reactions not catalysed by naturally occurring biocatalysts is a challenge for protein engineering and is a critical test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis. Here we describe the computational design of eight enzymes that use two different catalytic motifs to catalyse the Kemp elimination—a model reaction for proton transfer from carbon—with measured rate enhancements of up to 105 and multiple turnovers. Mutational analysis confirms that catalysis depends on the computationally designed active sites, and a high-resolution crystal structure suggests that the designs have close to atomic accuracy. Application of in vitro evolution to enhance the computational designs produced a >200-fold increase in kcat/Km (kcat/Km of 2,600 M-1s-1 and kcat/kuncat of >106). These results demonstrate the power of combining computational protein design with directed evolution for creating new enzymes, and we anticipate the creation of a wide range of useful new catalysts in the future.

AB  - The prediction of the structures of proteins without detectable sequence similarity to any protein of known structure remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we report significant progress in this area. We first describe de novo blind  structure predictions of unprecendented accuracy we made for two proteins in large families in the recent CASP11 blind test of protein structure prediction methods by incorporating residue–residue co-evolution information in the Rosetta structure prediction program. We then describe the use of this method to generate structure models for 58 of the 121 large protein families in prokaryotes for which three-dimensional structures are not available. These models, which are posted online for public access, provide structural information for the over 400,000 proteins belonging to the 58 families and suggest hypotheses about mechanism for the subset for which the function is known, and hypotheses about function for the remainder.

AB  - Advances over the past few years have begun to enable prediction and design of macromolecular structures at near-atomic accuracy. Progress has stemmed from the development of reasonably accurate and efficiently computed all-atom potential functions as well as effective conformational sampling strategies appropriate for searching a highly rugged energy landscape, both driven by feedback from structure prediction and design tests. A unified energetic and kinematic framework in the Rosetta program allows a wide range of molecular modeling problems, from fibril structure prediction to RNA folding to the design of new protein interfaces, to be readily investigated and highlights areas for improvement. The methodology enables the creation of novel molecules with useful functions and holds promise for accelerating experimental structural inference. Emerging connections to crystallographic phasing, NMR modeling, and lower-resolution approaches are described and critically assessed.

AB  - The ability to precisely design large proteins with diverse shapes would enable applications ranging from the design of protein binders that wrap around their target to the positioning of multiple functional sites in specified orientations. We describe a protein backbone design method for generating a wide range of rigid fusions between helix-containing proteins and use it to design 75,000 structurally unique junctions between monomeric and homo-oligomeric de novo designed and ankyrin repeat proteins (RPs). Of the junction designs that were experimentally characterized, 82% have circular dichroism and solution small-angle X-ray scattering profiles consistent with the design models and are stable at 95 °C. Crystal structures of four designed junctions were in close agreement with the design models with rmsds ranging from 0.9 to 1.6 Å. Electron microscopic images of extended tetrameric structures and ∼10-nm-diameter “L” and “V” shapes generated using the junctions are close to the design models, demonstrating the control the rigid junctions provide for protein shape sculpting over multiple nanometer length scales.

T2  - Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
AB  - In this article, I summarize recent work from my group directed towards developing an improved model of intra and intermolecular interactions and applying this improved model to the prediction and design of macromolecular structures and interactions. Prediction and design applications can be of great biological interest in their own right, and also provide very stringent and objective tests which drive the improvement of the model and increases in fundamental understanding. I emphasize the results from the prediction and design tests that suggest progress is being made in high-resolution modelling, and that there is hope for reliably and accurately computing structural biology.

AB  - Reliable structure-prediction methods for membrane proteins are important because the experimental determination of high-resolution membrane protein structures remains very difficult, especially for eukaryotic proteins. However, membrane proteins are typically longer than 200 aa and represent a formidable challenge for structure prediction. We have developed a method for predicting the structures of large membrane proteins by constraining helix–helix packing arrangements at particular positions predicted from sequence or identified by experiments. We tested the method on 12 membrane proteins of diverse topologies and functions with lengths ranging between 190 and 300 residues. Enforcing a single constraint during the folding simulations enriched the population of near-native models for 9 proteins. In 4 of the cases in which the constraint was predicted from the sequence, 1 of the 5 lowest energy models was superimposable within 4 Å on the native structure. Near-native structures could also be selected for heme-binding and pore-forming domains from simulations in which pairs of conserved histidine-chelating hemes and one experimentally determined salt bridge were constrained, respectively. These results suggest that models within 4 Å of the native structure can be achieved for complex membrane proteins if even limited information on residue-residue interactions can be obtained from protein structure databases or experiments.

AB  - The prediction of the structures and interactions of biological macromolecules at the atomic level and the design of new structures and interactions are critical tests of our understanding of the interatomic interactions that underlie molecular biology. Equally important, the capability to accurately predict and design macromolecular structures and interactions would streamline the interpretation of genome sequence information and allow the creation of macromolecules with new and useful functions. This review summarizes recent progress in modeling that suggests that we are entering an era in which high-resolution prediction and design will make increasingly important contributions to biology and medicine.

AU  - André, Ingemar

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - Biological supramolecular systems are commonly built up by the self-assembly of identical protein subunits to produce symmetrical oligomers with cyclical, icosahedral, or helical symmetry that play roles in processes ranging from allosteric control and molecular transport to motor action. The large size of these systems often makes them difficult to structurally characterize using experimental techniques. We have developed a computational protocol to predict the structure of symmetrical protein assemblies based on the structure of a single subunit. The method carries out simultaneous optimization of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom, while restricting the search space to symmetrical conformations. Using this protocol, we can reconstruct, starting from the structure of a single subunit, the structure of cyclic oligomers and the icosahedral virus capsid of satellite panicum virus using a rigid backbone approximation. We predict the oligomeric state of EscJ from the type III secretion system both in its proposed cyclical and crystallized helical form. Finally, we show that the method can recapitulate the structure of an amyloid-like fibril formed by the peptide NNQQNY from the yeast prion protein Sup35 starting from the amino acid sequence alone and searching the complete space of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom.

AB  - Significance
            Almost all proteins fold to their lowest free energy state, which is determined by their amino acid sequence. Computational protein design has primarily focused on finding sequences that have very low energy in the target designed structure. However, what is most relevant during folding is not the absolute energy of the folded state but the energy difference between the folded state and the lowest-lying alternative states. We describe a deep learning approach that captures aspects of the folding landscape, in particular the presence of structures in alternative energy minima, and show that it can enhance current protein design methods.
          , 
            The protein design problem is to identify an amino acid sequence that folds to a desired structure. Given Anfinsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis of folding, this can be recast as finding an amino acid sequence for which the desired structure is the lowest energy state. As this calculation involves not only all possible amino acid sequences but also, all possible structures, most current approaches focus instead on the more tractable problem of finding the lowest-energy amino acid sequence for the desired structure, often checking by protein structure prediction in a second step that the desired structure is indeed the lowest-energy conformation for the designed sequence, and typically discarding a large fraction of designed sequences for which this is not the case. Here, we show that by backpropagating gradients through the transform-restrained Rosetta (trRosetta) structure prediction network from the desired structure to the input amino acid sequence, we can directly optimize over all possible amino acid sequences and all possible structures in a single calculation. We find that trRosetta calculations, which consider the full conformational landscape, can be more effective than Rosetta single-point energy estimations in predicting folding and stability of de novo designed proteins. We compare sequence design by conformational landscape optimization with the standard energy-based sequence design methodology in Rosetta and show that the former can result in energy landscapes with fewer alternative energy minima. We show further that more funneled energy landscapes can be designed by combining the strengths of the two approaches: the low-resolution trRosetta model serves to disfavor alternative states, and the high-resolution Rosetta model serves to create a deep energy minimum at the design target structure.

AB  - Filling in the protein fold picture
            
              Fewer than a third of the 14,849 known protein families have at least one member with an experimentally determined structure. This leaves more than 5000 protein families with no structural information. Protein modeling using residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary data has been successful in modeling unknown structures, but it requires large numbers of aligned sequences. Ovchinnikov
              et al.
              augmented such sequence alignments with metagenome sequence data (see the Perspective by Söding). They determined the number of sequences required to allow modeling, developed criteria for model quality, and, where possible, improved modeling by matching predicted contacts to known structures. Their method predicted quality structural models for 614 protein families, of which about 140 represent newly discovered protein folds.

            Combining metagenome data with protein structure prediction generates models for 614 families with unknown structures.
          , 
            Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still ~5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact-based structure matching, and Rosetta structure calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the Protein Data Bank. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the Protein Structure Initiative at a fraction of the cost.

              Proteins represent the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals for a diverse range of clinical applications. Computational protein design has the potential to create a novel class of therapeutics with tunable biophysical properties. However, the immune system reacts to T-cell epitope sequences in non-human proteins, leading to neutralization and elimination by the immune system. Here, we combine machine learning with structure-based protein design to identify and redesign T-cell epitopes without disrupting function of the target protein. We test the method experimentally, removing T-cell epitopes from GFP and
              Pseudomonas
              exotoxin A while maintaining function.

              Immune responses can make protein therapeutics ineffective or even dangerous. We describe a general computational protein design method for reducing immunogenicity by eliminating known and predicted T-cell epitopes and maximizing the content of human peptide sequences without disrupting protein structure and function. We show that the method recapitulates previous experimental results on immunogenicity reduction, and we use it to disrupt T-cell epitopes in GFP and
              Pseudomonas
              exotoxin A without disrupting function.

TI  - Robust and accurate prediction of residue–residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information
AU  - Ovchinnikov, Sergey

AU  - Baker, David
T2  - eLife
AB  - Do the amino acid sequence identities of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution? If so, such covariance could be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes. We find that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein–protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. We use this method to make subunit contact predictions for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures, and present models based on these predictions for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter.
          , 
            Proteins are considered the ‘workhorse molecules’ of life and they are involved in virtually everything that cells do. Proteins are strings of amino acids that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape. Proteins must have the correct shape to function properly, as they often work by binding to other proteins or molecules—much like a key fitting into a lock. Working out the structure of a protein can, therefore, provide major insights into how the protein does its job.
            Two or more proteins can bind together and form a complex to perform various tasks; and solving the structures of these complexes can be challenging, even if the structures of the protein subunits are known. Now, Ovchinnikov, Kamisetty, and Baker have developed a method for predicting which parts of the proteins make contact with each other in a two-protein complex.
            Different species can have copies of the same proteins; but a copy from one species might have different amino acids at certain positions when compared to a related copy from another species. As such, when pairs of interacting proteins from different species are compared, there will be many positions in the two proteins that vary. However, if the amino acid at a position in one protein (let's call it ‘X’) varies, and the amino acid at, say, position ‘Y’ in the other protein also varies such that for any given amino acid at position Y there is often a specific amino acid at position X; positions X and Y are said to ‘co-vary’. Ovchinnikov et al. noticed that when a pair of amino acids (one from each protein in a two-protein complex) co-varied, these two amino acids tended to make contact with each other at the protein–protein interface.
            Ovchinnikov et al. used the new method to make predictions about the protein–protein interfaces in 28 protein complexes found in bacteria, and also to make a prediction about the interface between protein subunits in the bacterial ribosome. When these predictions were checked against the actual structures, which were all known beforehand, they were found to be accurate if the number of copies of each protein being compared is greater than the average length of the two proteins.
            Ovchinnikov et al. went on to predict the amino acids on the protein–protein interfaces for another 36 bacterial protein complexes with unknown structures, and to present models for four larger complexes. The next challenge is to extend the method to protein complexes that are found only in eukaryotes (i.e., not in bacteria). Since the number of related copies for eukaryotic proteins tends to be smaller, there are fewer proteins to compare and it is therefore harder to detect ‘covariation’ when it occurs.

AB  - Formation of many dsDNA viruses begins with the assembly of a procapsid, containing scaffolding proteins and a multisubunit portal but lacking DNA, which matures into an infectious virion. This process, conserved among dsDNA viruses such as herpes viruses and bacteriophages, is key to forming infectious virions. Bacteriophage P22 has served as a model system for this study in the past several decades. However, how capsid assembly is initiated, where and how scaffolding proteins bind to coat proteins in the procapsid, and the conformational changes upon capsid maturation still remain elusive. Here, we report Cα backbone models for the P22 procapsid and infectious virion derived from electron cryomicroscopy density maps determined at 3.8- and 4.0-Å resolution, respectively, and the first procapsid structure at subnanometer resolution without imposing symmetry. The procapsid structures show the scaffolding protein interacting electrostatically with the N terminus (N arm) of the coat protein through its C-terminal helix-loop-helix motif, as well as unexpected interactions between 10 scaffolding proteins and the 12-fold portal located at a unique vertex. These suggest a critical role for the scaffolding proteins both in initiating the capsid assembly at the portal vertex and propagating its growth on a
              T
               = 7 icosahedral lattice. Comparison of the procapsid and the virion backbone models reveals coordinated and complex conformational changes. These structural observations allow us to propose a more detailed molecular mechanism for the scaffolding-mediated capsid assembly initiation including portal incorporation, release of scaffolding proteins upon DNA packaging, and maturation into infectious virions.

AB  - The prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence is a grand challenge of computational molecular biology. By using a combination of improved low- and high-resolution conformational sampling methods, improved atomically detailed potential functions that capture the jigsaw puzzle–like packing of protein cores, and high-performance computing, high-resolution structure prediction (<1.5 angstroms) can be achieved for small protein domains (<85 residues). The primary bottleneck to consistent high-resolution prediction appears to be conformational sampling.

AB  - The prediction and design at the atomic level of membrane protein structures and interactions is a critical but unsolved challenge. To address this problem, we have developed an all-atom physical model that describes intraprotein and protein–solvent interactions in the membrane environment. We evaluated the ability of the model to recapitulate the energetics and structural specificities of polytopic membrane proteins by using a battery of
              in silico
              prediction and design tests. First, in side-chain packing and design tests, the model successfully predicts the side-chain conformations at 73% of nonexposed positions and the native amino acid identities at 34% of positions in naturally occurring membrane proteins. Second, the model predicts significant energy gaps between native and nonnative structures of transmembrane helical interfaces and polytopic membrane proteins. Third, distortions in transmembrane helices are successfully recapitulated in docking experiments by using fragments of ideal helices judiciously defined around helical kinks. Finally,
              de novo
              structure prediction reaches near-atomic accuracy (<2.5 Å) for several small membrane protein domains (<150 residues). The success of the model highlights the critical role of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stability and structural specificity of membrane protein structures and sets the stage for the high-resolution prediction and design of complex membrane protein architectures.

AB  - ABSTRACT
          
            Deep learning networks offer considerable opportunities for accurate structure prediction and design of biomolecules. While cyclic peptides have gained significant traction as a therapeutic modality, developing deep learning methods for designing such peptides has been slow, mostly due to the small number of available structures for molecules in this size range. Here, we report approaches to modify the AlphaFold network for accurate structure prediction and design of cyclic peptides. Our results show this approach can accurately predict the structures of native cyclic peptides from a single sequence, with 36 out of 49 cases predicted with high confidence (pLDDT > 0.85) matching the native structure with root mean squared deviation (RMSD) less than 1.5 Å. Further extending our approach, we describe computational methods for designing sequences of peptide backbones generated by other backbone sampling methods and for
            de novo
            design of new macrocyclic peptides. We extensively sampled the structural diversity of cyclic peptides between 7–13 amino acids, and identified around 10,000 unique design candidates predicted to fold into the designed structures with high confidence. X-ray crystal structures for seven sequences with diverse sizes and structures designed by our approach match very closely with the design models (root mean squared deviation < 1.0 Å), highlighting the atomic level accuracy in our approach. The computational methods and scaffolds developed here provide the basis for custom-designing peptides for targeted therapeutic applications.

AB  - A new generation of computationally intensive scientific research projects relies on volunteers from around the world contributing idle computer time to calculate mathematical models. Many of these projects utilize a common architecture to manage the scheduling and distribution of calculations and collection of results from participants. User engagement is critical to the success of these projects, and feedback to participants illustrating their role in the project’s progress is known to increase interest and strengthen the community. This article describes how one project – University of Washington’s Rosetta@Home, which predicts and designs the folded conformations of proteins and protein complexes – created a web-based, on-demand reporting system that graphically illustrates a user or team’s contributions to the project. The reporting service is also useful to the project scientists in assessing the utility of alternative models and computational techniques. The system relies on a comprehensive database platform that includes tools for data integration, data management, querying and web-based reporting. The reporting components integrate seamlessly with the rest of the project’s data and web infrastructure, and the report pages have proven to be popular among both participants and lab members.

              Biological function is driven by interaction between proteins. High-throughput experimental techniques have provided large datasets of protein interactions in several organisms; however, much combinatorial space remains uncharted. Cong
              et al.
              predict protein interfaces by identifying coevolving residues in aligned protein sequences (see the Perspective by Vajda and Emili). In comparison with gold-standard and negative control sets, they show that the accuracy is higher than for proteome-wide two-hybrid and mass spectrometry screens. The approach predicts 1618 protein interactions in
              Escherichia coli
              , 682 of which were unanticipated, and 911 interacting pairs in
              Mycobacterium tuberculosis
              , most of which had not been previously described. With an expected false-positive rate of between 10 and 20%, the predicted interactions and networks provide an excellent starting point for further study.

              Residue-residue coevolution has been observed across a number of protein-protein interfaces, but the extent of residue coevolution between protein families on the whole-proteome scale has not been systematically studied. We investigate coevolution between 5.4 million pairs of proteins in
              Escherichia coli
              and between 3.9 millions pairs in
              Mycobacterium tuberculosis
              . We find strong coevolution for binary complexes involved in metabolism and weaker coevolution for larger complexes playing roles in genetic information processing. We take advantage of this coevolution, in combination with structure modeling, to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with an accuracy that benchmark studies suggest is considerably higher than that of proteome-wide two-hybrid and mass spectrometry screens. We identify hundreds of previously uncharacterized PPIs in
              E. coli
              and
              M. tuberculosis

              Structure-based virtual screening is a key tool in early drug discovery, with growing interest in the screening of multi-billion chemical compound libraries. However, the success of virtual screening crucially depends on the accuracy of the binding pose and binding affinity predicted by computational docking. Here we develop a highly accurate structure-based virtual screen method, RosettaVS, for predicting docking poses and binding affinities. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of benchmarks, partially due to our ability to model receptor flexibility. We incorporate this into a new open-source artificial intelligence accelerated virtual screening platform for drug discovery. Using this platform, we screen multi-billion compound libraries against two unrelated targets, a ubiquitin ligase target KLHDC2 and the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na
              V
              1.7. For both targets, we discover hit compounds, including seven hits (14% hit rate) to KLHDC2 and four hits (44% hit rate) to Na
              V
              1.7, all with single digit micromolar binding affinities. Screening in both cases is completed in less than seven days. Finally, a high resolution X-ray crystallographic structure validates the predicted docking pose for the KLHDC2 ligand complex, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in lead discovery.

              Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions
              1,2
              . Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry
              3
              . Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96 nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design.

AB  - Summary
Many growth factors and cytokines signal by binding to the extracellular domains of their receptors and driving association and transphosphorylation of the receptor intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, initiating downstream signaling cascades. To enable systematic exploration of how receptor valency and geometry affect signaling outcomes, we designed cyclic homo-oligomers with up to 8 subunits using repeat protein building blocks that can be modularly extended. By incorporating a de novo-designed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-binding module into these scaffolds, we generated a series of synthetic signaling ligands that exhibit potent valency- and geometry-dependent Ca2+ release and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. The high specificity of the designed agonists reveals distinct roles for two FGFR splice variants in driving arterial endothelium and perivascular cell fates during early vascular development. Our designed modular assemblies should be broadly useful for unraveling the complexities of signaling in key developmental transitions and for developing future therapeutic applications.

AB  - Abstract
            In natural proteins, structured loops have central roles in molecular recognition, signal transduction and enzyme catalysis. However, because of the intrinsic flexibility and irregularity of loop regions, organizing multiple structured loops at protein functional sites has been very difficult to achieve by de novo protein design. Here we describe a solution to this problem that designs tandem repeat proteins with structured loops (9–14 residues) buttressed by extensive hydrogen bonding interactions. Experimental characterization shows that the designs are monodisperse, highly soluble, folded and thermally stable. Crystal structures are in close agreement with the design models, with the loops structured and buttressed as designed. We demonstrate the functionality afforded by loop buttressing by designing and characterizing binders for extended peptides in which the loops form one side of an extended binding pocket. The ability to design multiple structured loops should contribute generally to efforts to design new protein functions.

AB  - Abstract
            Programming protein nanomaterials to respond to changes in environmental conditions is a current challenge for protein design and is important for targeted delivery of biologics. Here we describe the design of octahedral non-porous nanoparticles with a targeting antibody on the two-fold symmetry axis, a designed trimer programmed to disassemble below a tunable pH transition point on the three-fold axis, and a designed tetramer on the four-fold symmetry axis. Designed non-covalent interfaces guide cooperative nanoparticle assembly from independently purified components, and a cryo-EM density map closely matches the computational design model. The designed nanoparticles can package protein and nucleic acid payloads, are endocytosed following antibody-mediated targeting of cell surface receptors, and undergo tunable pH-dependent disassembly at pH values ranging between 5.9 and 6.7. The ability to incorporate almost any antibody into a non-porous pH-dependent nanoparticle opens up new routes to antibody-directed targeted delivery.

AB  - Small macrocycles with four or fewer amino acids are among the most potent natural products known, but there is currently no way to systematically generate such compounds. We describe a computational method for identifying ordered macrocycles composed of alpha, beta, gamma, and 17 other amino acid backbone chemistries, which we used to predict 14.9 million closed cycles composed of >42,000 monomer combinations. We chemically synthesized 18 macrocycles predicted to adopt single low-energy states and determined their x-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structures; 15 of these were very close to the design models. We illustrate the therapeutic potential of these macrocycle designs by developing selective inhibitors of three protein targets of current interest. By opening up a vast space of readily synthesizable drug-like macrocycles, our results should considerably enhance structure-based drug design.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Small cyclic peptides, or macrocycles, are a common structural class for natural products because their constrained flexibility facilitates binding to other biological molecules. Salveson
              et al
              . used a deep neural network to generate energy surfaces and extract low-energy conformations for macrocycles built from a combination of 130 amino acids across 22 different backbone chemistries. They used this data to identify nearly 15 million combinations that lead to closed macrocycles and characterized the predictions experimentally. Using motif scaffolding based on peptide fragments, the authors generated macrocyclic binders to two enzymes. They also developed a protein-protein interaction inhibitor by virtual screening of the predicted macrocycles. —Michael A. Funk

AB  - Abstract
            Biological evolution has led to precise and dynamic nanostructures that reconfigure in response to pH and other environmental conditions. However, designing micrometre-scale protein nanostructures that are environmentally responsive remains a challenge. Here we describe the de novo design of pH-responsive protein filaments built from subunits containing six or nine buried histidine residues that assemble into micrometre-scale, well-ordered fibres at neutral pH. The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of an optimized design is nearly identical to the computational design model for both the subunit internal geometry and the subunit packing into the fibre. Electron, fluorescent and atomic force microscopy characterization reveal a sharp and reversible transition from assembled to disassembled fibres over 0.3 pH units, and rapid fibre disassembly in less than 1 s following a drop in pH. The midpoint of the transition can be tuned by modulating buried histidine-containing hydrogen bond networks. Computational protein design thus provides a route to creating unbound nanomaterials that rapidly respond to small pH changes.

              Segments of proteins with high β-strand propensity can self-associate to form amyloid fibrils implicated in many diseases. We describe a general approach to bind such segments in β-strand and β-hairpin conformations using de novo designed scaffolds that contain deep peptide-binding clefts. The designs bind their cognate peptides in vitro with nanomolar affinities. The crystal structure of a designed protein−peptide complex is close to the design model, and NMR characterization reveals how the peptide-binding cleft is protected in the apo state. We use the approach to design binders to the amyloid-forming proteins transthyretin, tau, serum amyloid A1 and amyloid β
              1−42
              (Aβ42). The Aβ binders block the assembly of Aβ fibrils as effectively as the most potent of the clinically tested antibodies to date and protect cells from toxic Aβ42 species.

AB  - Abstract
            
              A wooden house frame consists of many different lumber pieces, but because of the regularity of these building blocks, the structure can be designed using straightforward geometrical principles. The design of multicomponent protein assemblies, in comparison, has been much more complex, largely owing to the irregular shapes of protein structures
              1
              . Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight ‘train track’ assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted. Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence–structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to ‘back of an envelope’ architectural blueprints.

AB  - Deep-learning methods have revolutionized protein structure prediction and design but are presently limited to protein-only systems. We describe RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), which combines a residue-based representation of amino acids and DNA bases with an atomic representation of all other groups to model assemblies that contain proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications, given their sequences and chemical structures. By fine-tuning on denoising tasks, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which builds protein structures around small molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we designed and experimentally validated, through crystallography and binding measurements, proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and the light-harvesting molecule bilin.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Advances in machine learning have made protein structure prediction and design much more accurate and accessible in recent years, but these tools have generally been limited to polypeptide chains. However, ligands such as small molecules, metal ions, and nucleic acids are crucial components of most proteins, both in terms of structure and biological function. Krishna
              et al
              . present a next-generation protein structure prediction and design tool, RoseTTAFold All-Atom, that can accept a wide range of ligands and covalent amino acid modifications. The authors demonstrate superior performance on protein-ligand structure prediction relative to other tools, even in the absence of an input experimental structure. They also perform de novo design of proteins to bind cofactors and small molecules and experimentally validate these designs. —Michael A. Funk

              INTRODUCTION
              Proteins rarely act alone; they form complexes with other proteins in cell signaling, interact with DNA and RNA during transcription and translation, and interact with small molecules both covalently and noncovalently during metabolism and signaling. Despite substantial recent progress in protein-only structure prediction, modeling such general biomolecular assemblies remains an outstanding challenge.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              We set out to develop a unified structure prediction and design approach for assemblies containing proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and chemical modifications. We sought to combine a sequence-based description of proteins and nucleic acids with an atomic graph representation of small molecules and protein covalent modifications. We started with the RoseTTAFold2 (RF2) network, which takes as input one-dimensional (1D) sequence information, 2D pairwise distance information from homologous templates, and 3D coordinate information and iteratively improves predicted structures through many hidden layers.
            
            
              RESULTS
              For our biomolecular structure prediction network RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA) (see the figure, top), we retained the representations of protein and nucleic acid chains from RF2 and represented arbitrary small molecules as atom-bond graphs. To the 1D track, we input the chemical element type of each nonpolymer atom; to the 2D track, the chemical bonds between atoms; and to the 3D track, information on chirality. Immediately after input, the full system was represented as a disconnected gas of amino acid residues, nucleic acid bases, and freely moving atoms, which was successively transformed through the many blocks of the network into physically plausible assembly structures. We trained RFAA on protein–small molecule, protein-metal, and covalently modified protein complexes that are found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), filtering out common solvents and crystallization additives.
              In the CAMEO blind ligand-docking challenge, RFAA outperforms baseline automated pipelines. Although not all predictions are accurate, the network outputs a confidence estimate that correlates with accuracy. The network generalizes beyond the training set: Accurate predictions are made for proteins with low sequence homology (BLAST e-value >1) and ligands with low similarity (Tanimoto similarity <0.5) to those in the training set. Prediction accuracy is higher for protein–small molecule complexes with more-favorable computed interaction energies using a molecular mechanics force field, which suggests that RFAA has learned aspects of the physical chemistry of protein–small molecule interactions. Nearly half (46%) of covalent modifications are predicted accurately [<2.5-Å root mean square deviation (RMSD)]. These additional prediction capabilities do not come at the expense of the protein structure–prediction task because RFAA has a prediction accuracy on protein monomer structures comparable to that AlphaFold2.
              For small-molecule binder design, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA) by fine-tuning RFAA on diffusion denoising tasks. Starting from random residue distributions, RFdiffusionAA generates folded protein structures that surround the small molecule. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on native or preexisting designed scaffolds, the binding pockets are custom generated for each ligand of interest. We generated small-molecule binding designs for the cardiac disease drug digoxigenin, the enzyme cofactor heme, and optically active bilin molecules. In each case, experimental characterization showed that a subset of the designs had the designed binding activity. The crystal structure of a heme binding design matched the RFdiffusionAA model very closely (0.86-Å Cα RMSD).
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              RFAA demonstrates that a single neural network can be trained to accurately model general biomolecular assemblies containing a wide diversity of nonprotein components. Although there is still room for improvement in prediction accuracy, we anticipate that RFAA should be broadly useful for modeling full biological assemblies and RFdiffusionAA for designing small molecule–binding proteins and sensors.
              
                
                  Prediction and design of biomolecular assemblies.
                  RFAA enables the prediction of biomolecular assemblies, including proteins, nucleic acids, metals, small molecules, and covalent modifications (top). RFdiffusionAA builds de novo proteins around small molecules of interest (bottom).

AB  - Relating the macroscopic properties of protein-based materials to their underlying component microstructure is an outstanding challenge. Here, we exploit computational design to specify the size, flexibility, and valency of de novo protein building blocks, as well as the interaction dynamics between them, to investigate how molecular parameters govern the macroscopic viscoelasticity of the resultant protein hydrogels. We construct gel systems from pairs of symmetric protein homo-oligomers, each comprising 2, 5, 24, or 120 individual protein components, that are crosslinked either physically or covalently into idealized step-growth biopolymer networks. Through rheological assessment, we find that the covalent linkage of multifunctional precursors yields hydrogels whose viscoelasticity depends on the crosslink length between the constituent building blocks. In contrast, reversibly crosslinking the homo-oligomeric components with a computationally designed heterodimer results in viscoelastic biomaterials exhibiting fluid-like properties under rest and low shear, but solid-like behavior at higher frequencies. Exploiting the unique genetic encodability of these materials, we demonstrate the assembly of protein networks within living mammalian cells and show via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) that mechanical properties can be tuned intracellularly in a manner similar to formulations formed extracellularly. We anticipate that the ability to modularly construct and systematically program the viscoelastic properties of designer protein-based materials could have broad utility in biomedicine, with applications in tissue engineering, therapeutic delivery, and synthetic biology.

AB  - Abstract
            The utility of genetically encoded biosensors for sensing the activity of signaling proteins has been hampered by a lack of strategies for matching sensor sensitivity to the physiological concentration range of the target. Here we used computational protein design to generate intracellular sensors of Ras activity (LOCKR-based Sensor for Ras activity (Ras-LOCKR-S)) and proximity labelers of the Ras signaling environment (LOCKR-based, Ras activity-dependent Proximity Labeler (Ras-LOCKR-PL)). These tools allow the detection of endogenous Ras activity and labeling of the surrounding environment at subcellular resolution. Using these sensors in human cancer cell lines, we identified Ras-interacting proteins in oncogenic EML4-Alk granules and found that Src-Associated in Mitosis 68-kDa (SAM68) protein specifically enhances Ras activity in the granules. The ability to subcellularly localize endogenous Ras activity should deepen our understanding of Ras function in health and disease and may suggest potential therapeutic strategies.

              1
              . Here we use a robust deep learning pipeline to design complex folds and soluble analogues of integral membrane proteins. Unique membrane topologies, such as those from G-protein-coupled receptors
              2
              , are not found in the soluble proteome, and we demonstrate that their structural features can be recapitulated in solution. Biophysical analyses demonstrate the high thermal stability of the designs, and experimental structures show remarkable design accuracy. The soluble analogues were functionalized with native structural motifs, as a proof of concept for bringing membrane protein functions to the soluble proteome, potentially enabling new approaches in drug discovery. In summary, we have designed complex protein topologies and enriched them with functionalities from membrane proteins, with high experimental success rates, leading to a de facto expansion of the functional soluble fold space.

              Many peptide hormones form an α-helix on binding their receptors
              1–4
              , and sensitive methods for their detection could contribute to better clinical management of disease
              5
              . De novo protein design can now generate binders with high affinity and specificity to structured proteins
              6,7
              . However, the design of interactions between proteins and short peptides with helical propensity is an unmet challenge. Here we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that by extending RFdiffusion
              8
              to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors. The ability to design binders to conformationally variable targets, and to optimize by partial diffusion both natural and designed proteins, should be broadly useful.

              Biomolecules modulate inorganic crystallization to generate hierarchically structured biominerals, but the atomic structure of the organic-inorganic interfaces that regulate mineralization remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that heterogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate could be achieved by a structured flat molecular template that pre-organizes calcium ions on its surface. To test this hypothesis, we design helical repeat proteins (DHRs) displaying regularly spaced carboxylate arrays on their surfaces and find that both protein monomers and protein-Ca

              supramolecular assemblies directly nucleate nano-calcite with non-natural {110} or {202} faces while vaterite, which forms first in the absence of the proteins, is bypassed. These protein-stabilized nanocrystals then assemble by oriented attachment into calcite mesocrystals. We find further that nanocrystal size and polymorph can be tuned by varying the length and surface chemistry of the designed protein templates. Thus, bio-mineralization can be programmed using de novo protein design, providing a route to next-generation hybrid materials.

AB  - Despite the increasing number of GPCR structures and recent advances in peptide design, the development of efficient technologies allowing rational design of high-affinity peptide ligands for single GPCRs remains an unmet challenge. Here, we develop a computational approach for designing conjugates of lariat-shaped macrocyclized peptides and a small molecule opioid ligand. We demonstrate its feasibility by discovering chemical scaffolds for the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) with desired pharmacological activities. The designed De Novo Cyclic Peptide (DNCP)-β-naloxamine (NalA) exhibit in vitro potent mixed KOR agonism/mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism, nanomolar binding affinity, selectivity, and efficacy bias at KOR. Proof-of-concept in vivo efficacy studies demonstrate that DNCP-β-NalA(1) induces a potent KOR-mediated antinociception in male mice. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure (2.6 Å) of the DNCP-β-NalA–KOR–Gi1 complex and molecular dynamics simulations are harnessed to validate the computational design model. This reveals a network of residues in ECL2/3 and TM6/7 controlling the intrinsic efficacy of KOR. In general, our computational de novo platform overcomes extensive lead optimization encountered in ultra-large library docking and virtual small molecule screening campaigns and offers innovation for GPCR ligand discovery. This may drive the development of next-generation therapeutics for medical applications such as pain conditions.

AB  - Abstract
            Protein–RNA and protein–DNA complexes play critical roles in biology. Despite considerable recent advances in protein structure prediction, the prediction of the structures of protein–nucleic acid complexes without homology to known complexes is a largely unsolved problem. Here we extend the RoseTTAFold machine learning protein-structure-prediction approach to additionally predict nucleic acid and protein–nucleic acid complexes. We develop a single trained network, RoseTTAFoldNA, that rapidly produces three-dimensional structure models with confidence estimates for protein–DNA and protein–RNA complexes. Here we show that confident predictions have considerably higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods. RoseTTAFoldNA should be broadly useful for modeling the structure of naturally occurring protein–nucleic acid complexes, and for designing sequence-specific RNA and DNA-binding proteins.

AB  - Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain–side-chain interactions across protein–protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein–protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering.

AB  - In pseudocyclic proteins, such as TIM barrels, β barrels, and some helical transmembrane channels, a single subunit is repeated in a cyclic pattern, giving rise to a central cavity that can serve as a pocket for ligand binding or enzymatic activity. Inspired by these proteins, we devised a deep-learning-based approach to broadly exploring the space of closed repeat proteins starting from only a specification of the repeat number and length. Biophysical data for 38 structurally diverse pseudocyclic designs produced in Escherichia coli are consistent with the design models, and the three crystal structures we were able to obtain are very close to the designed structures. Docking studies suggest the diversity of folds and central pockets provide effective starting points for designing small-molecule binders and enzymes.

AB  - Abstract
            The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8 are clinically validated cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds that can discriminate between homologous αvβ6 and αvβ8 and other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have high thermal stability could have considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecule and antibody inhibitors do not have all these properties, and hence new approaches are needed. Here we describe a generalized method for computationally designing RGD-containing miniproteins selective for a single RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state. We design hyperstable, selective αvβ6 and αvβ8 inhibitors that bind with picomolar affinity. CryoEM structures of the designed inhibitor-integrin complexes are very close to the computational design models, and show that the inhibitors stabilize specific conformational states of the αvβ6 and the αvβ8 integrins. In a lung fibrosis mouse model, the αvβ6 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved overall lung mechanics, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin binding proteins with high selectivity.

AB  - Predicting the effects of mutations on protein function and stability is an outstanding challenge. Here, we assess the performance of a variant of RoseTTAFold jointly trained for sequence and structure recovery, RFjoint, for mutation effect prediction. Without any further training, we achieve comparable accuracy in predicting mutation effects for a diverse set of protein families using RFjoint to both another zero-shot model (MSA Transformer) and a model that requires specific training on a particular protein family for mutation effect prediction (DeepSequence). Thus, although the architecture of RFjoint was developed to address the protein design problem of scaffolding functional motifs, RFjoint acquired an understanding of the mutational landscapes of proteins during model training that is equivalent to that of recently developed large protein language models. The ability to simultaneously reason over protein structure and sequence could enable even more precise mutation effect predictions following supervised training on the task. These results suggest that RFjoint has a quite broad understanding of protein sequence-structure landscapes, and can be viewed as a joint model for protein sequence and structure which could be broadly useful for protein modeling.

              Molecular systems with coincident cyclic and superhelical symmetry axes have considerable advantages for materials design as they can be readily lengthened or shortened by changing the length of the constituent monomers. Among proteins, alpha-helical coiled coils have such symmetric, extendable architectures, but are limited by the relatively fixed geometry and flexibility of the helical protomers. Here we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident

              and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibres can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibres can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches.

AB  - Targeted intracellular delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis requires the delivered cargo to escape the endosome to prevent lysosomal degradation. This can in principle be achieved by membrane lysis tightly restricted to endosomal membranes upon internalization to avoid general membrane insertion and lysis. Here, we describe the design of small monomeric proteins with buried histidine containing pH-responsive hydrogen bond networks and membrane permeating amphipathic helices. Of the 30 designs that were experimentally tested, all expressed in Escherichia coli, 13 were monomeric with the expected secondary structure, and 4 designs disrupted artificial liposomes in a pH-dependent manner. Mutational analysis showed that the buried histidine hydrogen bond networks mediate pH-responsiveness and control lysis of model membranes within a very narrow range of pH (6.0–5.5) with almost no lysis occurring at neutral pH. These tightly controlled lytic monomers could help mediate endosomal escape in designed targeted delivery platforms.

AB  - In nature, proteins that switch between two conformations in response to environmental stimuli structurally transduce biochemical information in a manner analogous to how transistors control information flow in computing devices. Designing proteins with two distinct but fully structured conformations is a challenge for protein design as it requires sculpting an energy landscape with two distinct minima. Here we describe the design of “hinge” proteins that populate one designed state in the absence of ligand and a second designed state in the presence of ligand. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and binding measurements demonstrate that despite the significant structural differences the two states are designed with atomic level accuracy and that the conformational and binding equilibria are closely coupled.
          , 
            Editor’s summary
            
              Natural proteins often adopt multiple conformational states, thereby changing their activity or binding partners in response to another protein, small molecule, or other stimulus. It has been difficult to engineer such conformational switching between two folded states in human-designed proteins. Praetorius
              et al
              . developed a hinge-like protein by simultaneously considering both desired states in the design process. The successful designs exhibited a large shift in conformation upon binding to a target peptide helix, which could be tailored for specificity. The authors characterized the protein structures, binding kinetics, and conformational equilibrium of the designs. This work provides the groundwork for generating protein switches that respond to biological triggers and can produce conformational changes that modulate protein assemblies. —Michael A. Funk

AB  - There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods1–9. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.

AB  - As a result of evolutionary selection, the subunits of naturally occurring protein assemblies often fit together with substantial shape complementarity to generate architectures optimal for function in a manner not achievable by current design approaches. We describe a “top-down” reinforcement learning–based design approach that solves this problem using Monte Carlo tree search to sample protein conformers in the context of an overall architecture and specified functional constraints. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the designed disk-shaped nanopores and ultracompact icosahedra are very close to the computational models. The icosohedra enable very-high-density display of immunogens and signaling molecules, which potentiates vaccine response and angiogenesis induction. Our approach enables the top-down design of complex protein nanomaterials with desired system properties and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning in protein design.

AB  - General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone1–3. Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein–peptide systems4–11, we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone12. The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.

AB  - Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy–based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 Å rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.

AB  - De novo enzyme design has sought to introduce active sites and substrate-binding pockets that are predicted to catalyse a reaction of interest into geometrically compatible native scaffolds1,2, but has been limited by a lack of suitable protein structures and the complexity of native protein sequence–structure relationships. Here we describe a deep-learning-based ‘family-wide hallucination’ approach that generates large numbers of idealized protein structures containing diverse pocket shapes and designed sequences that encode them. We use these scaffolds to design artificial luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates diphenylterazine3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9 kDa) and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95 °C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine (kcat/Km = 106 M−1 s−1) comparable to that of native luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity. The creation of highly active and specific biocatalysts from scratch with broad applications in biomedicine is a key milestone for computational enzyme design, and our approach should enable generation of a wide range of luciferases and other enzymes.

AB  - Peptide-binding proteins play key roles in biology, and predicting their binding specificity is a long-standing challenge. While considerable protein structural information is available, the most successful current methods use sequence information alone, in part because it has been a challenge to model the subtle structural changes accompanying sequence substitutions. Protein structure prediction networks such as AlphaFold model sequence-structure relationships very accurately, and we reasoned that if it were possible to specifically train such networks on binding data, more generalizable models could be created. We show that placing a classifier on top of the AlphaFold network and fine-tuning the combined network parameters for both classification and structure prediction accuracy leads to a model with strong generalizable performance on a wide range of Class I and Class II peptide-MHC interactions that approaches the overall performance of the state-of-the-art NetMHCpan sequence-based method. The peptide-MHC optimized model shows excellent performance in distinguishing binding and non-binding peptides to SH3 and PDZ domains. This ability to generalize well beyond the training set far exceeds that of sequence-only models and should be particularly powerful for systems where less experimental data are available.

AB  - The de novo design of three protein chains that associate to form a heterotrimer (but not any of the possible two-chain heterodimers) and that can drive the assembly of higher-order branching structures is an important challenge for protein design. We designed helical heterotrimers with specificity conferred by buried hydrogen bond networks and large aromatic residues to enhance shape complementary packing. We obtained ten designs for which all three chains cooperatively assembled into heterotrimers with few or no other species present. Crystal structures of a helical bundle heterotrimer and extended versions, with helical repeat proteins fused to individual subunits, showed all three chains assembling in the designed orientation. We used these heterotrimers as building blocks to construct larger cyclic oligomers, which were structurally validated by electron microscopy. Our three-way junction designs provide new routes to complex protein nanostructures and enable the scaffolding of three distinct ligands for modulation of cell signaling.

AB  - While native scaffolds offer a large diversity of shapes and topologies for enzyme engineering, their often unpredictable behavior in response to sequence modification makes de novo generated scaffolds an exciting alternative. Here we explore the customization of the backbone and sequence of a de novo designed eight stranded β-barrel protein to create catalysts for a retro-aldolase model reaction. We show that active and specific catalysts can be designed in this fold and use directed evolution to further optimize activity and stereoselectivity. Our results support previous suggestions that different folds have different inherent amenability to evolution and this property could account, in part, for the distribution of natural enzymes among different folds.

AB  - Function follows form in biology, and the binding of small molecules requires proteins with pockets that match the shape of the ligand. For design of binding to symmetric ligands, protein homo-oligomers with matching symmetry are advantageous as each protein subunit can make identical interactions with the ligand. Here, we describe a general approach to designing hyperstable C2 symmetric proteins with pockets of diverse size and shape. We first designed repeat proteins that sample a continuum of curvatures but have low helical rise, then docked these into C2 symmetric homodimers to generate an extensive range of C2 symmetric cavities. We used this approach to design thousands of C2 symmetric homodimers, and characterized 101 of them experimentally. Of these, the geometry of 31 were confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering and 2 were shown by crystallographic analyses to be in close agreement with the computational design models. These scaffolds provide a rich set of starting points for binding a wide range of C2 symmetric compounds.

AB  - The binding and catalytic functions of proteins are generally mediated by a small number of functional residues held in place by the overall protein structure. Here, we describe deep learning approaches for scaffolding such functional sites without needing to prespecify the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold. The first approach, “constrained hallucination,” optimizes sequences such that their predicted structures contain the desired functional site. The second approach, “inpainting,” starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained RoseTTAFold network. We use these two methods to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins and validate the designs using a combination of in silico and experimental tests.

AB  - Asymmetric multiprotein complexes that undergo subunit exchange play central roles in biology but present a challenge for design because the components must not only contain interfaces that enable reversible association but also be stable and well behaved in isolation. We use implicit negative design to generate β sheet–mediated heterodimers that can be assembled into a wide variety of complexes. The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems.

AB  - The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge1–5. Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder–target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein–protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

AB  - New variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to arise and prolong the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, we used a cell-free expression workflow to rapidly screen and optimize constructs containing multiple computationally designed miniprotein inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. We found the broadest efficacy was achieved with a homotrimeric version of the 75-residue angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mimic AHB2 (TRI2-2) designed to geometrically match the trimeric spike architecture. Consistent with the design model, in the cryo-electron microscopy structure TRI2-2 forms a tripod at the apex of the spike protein that engaged all three receptor binding domains simultaneously. TRI2-2 neutralized Omicron (B.1.1.529), Delta (B.1.617.2), and all other variants tested with greater potency than the monoclonal antibodies used clinically for the treatment of COVID-19. TRI2-2 also conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge when administered intranasally in mice. Designed miniprotein receptor mimics geometrically arrayed to match pathogen receptor binding sites could be a widely applicable antiviral therapeutic strategy with advantages over antibodies in greater resistance to viral escape and antigenic drift, and advantages over native receptor traps in lower chances of autoimmune responses.

              Many types of SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing therapeutics have been developed, with antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 decoys being the most common. However, other approaches merit investigation, particularly because variants of concern evade existing therapeutics. Here, Hunt
              et al.
              developed and produced multivalent minibinders that recognize the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. One homotrimeric minibinder, TRI2-2, formed a tripod structure that interacted with all three RBDs of the spike trimer. TRI2-2 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including omicron, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice prophylactically and therapeutically. Together, these data support further investigation into multivalent minibinders as therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2.
