AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The design and implementation of ImageMiner, a software platform for performing comparative analysis of expression patterns in imaged microscopy specimens such as tissue microarrays (TMAs), is described. ImageMiner is a federated system of services that provides a reliable set of analytical and data management capabilities for investigative research applications in pathology. It provides a library of image processing methods, including automated registration, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification, all of which have been tailored, in these studies, to support TMA analysis. The system is designed to leverage high-performance computing machines so that investigators can rapidly analyze large ensembles of imaged TMA specimens. To support deployment in collaborative, multi-institutional projects, ImageMiner features grid-enabled, service-based components so that multiple instances of ImageMiner can be accessed remotely and federated.
RESULTS: The experimental evaluation shows that: (1) ImageMiner is able to support reliable detection and feature extraction of tumor regions within imaged tissues; (2) images and analysis results managed in ImageMiner can be searched for and retrieved on the basis of image-based features, classification information, and any correlated clinical data, including any metadata that have been generated to describe the specified tissue and TMA; and (3) the system is able to reduce computation time of analyses by exploiting computing clusters, which facilitates analysis of larger sets of tissue samples.

AB  - Large-scale, multisite collaboration has become indispensable for a wide range of research and clinical activities that rely on the capacity of individuals to dynamically acquire, share, and assess images and correlated data. In this paper, we report the development of a Web-based system, PathMiner , for interactive telemedicine, intelligent archiving, and automated decision support in pathology. The PathMiner system supports network-based submission of queries and can automatically locate and retrieve digitized pathology specimens along with correlated molecular studies of cases from "ground-truth" databases that exhibit spectral and spatial profiles consistent with a given query image. The statistically most probable diagnosis is provided to the individual who is seeking decision support. To test the system under real-case scenarios, a pipeline infrastructure was developed and a network-based test laboratory was established at strategic sites at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, and Rutgers University. The average five-class classification accuracy of the system was 93.18% based on a tenfold cross validation on a close dataset containing 3691 imaged specimens. We also conducted prospective performance studies with the PathMiner system in real applications in which the specimens exhibited large variations in staining characters compared with the training data. The average five-class classification accuracy in this open-set experiment was 87.22%. We also provide the comparative results with the previous literature and the PathMiner system shows superior performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND Autophagy is a starvation induced cellular process of self-digestion that allows cells to degrade cytoplasmic contents. The understanding of autophagy, as either a mechanism of resistance to therapies that induce metabolic stress, or as a means to cell death, is rapidly expanding and supportive of a new paradigm of therapeutic starvation. METHODS To determine the effect of therapeutic starvation in prostate cancer, we studied the effect of the prototypical inhibitor of metabolism, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), in multiple cellular models including a transfected pEGFP-LC3 autophagy reporter construct in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. RESULTS We found that 2DG induced cytotoxicity in PC-3 and LNCaP cells in a dose dependent fashion. We also found that 2DG modulated checkpoint proteins cdk4, and cdk6. Using the transfected pEGFP-LC3 autophagy reporter construct, we found that 2DG induced LC3 membrane translocation, characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, knockdown of beclin1, an essential regulator of autophagy, abrogated 2DG induced autophagy. Using Western analysis for LC3 protein, we also found increased LC3-II expression in 2DG treated cells, again consistent with autophagy. In an effort to develop markers that may be predictive of autophagy, for assessment in clinical trials, we stained human prostate tumors for Beclin1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, we used a digitized imaging algorithm to quantify Beclin1 staining assessment. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate the induction of autophagy in prostate cancer by therapeutic starvation with 2DG, and support the feasibility of assessment of markers predictive of autophagy such as Beclin1 that can be utilized in clinical trials.
