AB  - Climateprediction.net aims to harness the spare CPU cycles of a million individual users PCs to run a massive ensemble of climate simulations using an up-to-date, full-scale 3D atmosphere-ocean climate model. Although it has many similarities with other public-resource computing projects, it is distinguished by the complexity of its computational task, its system demands and the level of participant interaction, data volume and analysis procedures. For simulations running on individual PCs, there is a requirement for visualizations that are compelling and readily grasped, since most users will be interested in the output from the model, but will have a limited level of scientific experience. This paper describes the design and implementation of these visualizations.

AB  - Abstract
            A climate model emulator is developed using neural network techniques and trained with the data from the multithousand-member climateprediction.net perturbed physics GCM ensemble. The method recreates nonlinear interactions between model parameters, allowing a simulation of a much larger ensemble that explores model parameter space more fully.
            The emulated ensemble is used to search for models closest to observations over a wide range of equilibrium response to greenhouse gas forcing. The relative discrepancies of these models from observations could be used to provide a constraint on climate sensitivity. The use of annual mean or seasonal differences on top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes as an observational error metric results in the most clearly defined minimum in error as a function of sensitivity, with consistent but less well-defined results when using the seasonal cycles of surface temperature or total precipitation.
            The model parameter changes necessary to achieve different values of climate sensitivity while minimizing discrepancy from observation are also considered and compared with previous studies. This information is used to propose more efficient parameter sampling strategies for future ensembles.

AB  - Abstract
            2015 saw the strongest El Niño event in the historical record, resulting in extreme drought conditions in Brazil. As drought conditions may also lead to greater fire danger, this study uses the 2015 fire in Brazil as a case study to examine whether and to what extent human-induced climate change has contributed to the fire weather conditions in the Cerrado and the southern Amazonia transitional forests known as the Arc of deforestation. Our results show that anthropogenic climate change is indeed a driver of meteorological conditions conducive to strong fire weather in these two regions, measured by fire weather index (FWI), especially on shorter timescales of daily and weekly. The anthropogenic climate change signal of FWI on short timescales corresponds to a similar order of increase in the FWI sub-indices (initial spread index and fine fuel moisture code) that can rapidly change due to the influence of the instantaneous weather conditions. For both regions the changes in fire weather in response to anthropogenic climate change are dominated by the combination of temperature and relative humidity responses. High FWI is more likely to occur under El Niño conditions, less likely under La Niña conditions, although the impacts of El Niño vs La Niña conditions are not symmetric when compared with El Niño Southern Oscillation neutral states. To summarize, both human-induced climate change and the presence of El Niño increased the likelihood of occurrence for the strong fire weather condition in 2015. Our results suggest that local and regional adaptation measures, such as improved drought monitoring and warning systems, could help with effective planning of fire prevention, firefighting actions, and disaster preparedness.

AB  - For public, scientists and policy-makers, it is important to know to what extent human-induced climate change played (or did not play) a role behind changing risks of extreme weather events. Probabilistic event attribution (PEA) can provide scientific information regarding this association and reveal whether and to what extent external drivers of climate change have influenced the probability of high-impact weather events. To date, most of the PEA-based studies have focused on extreme events of mid-latitudes and predominantly events that have occurred in the developed countries. Developing countries located at the tropical monsoon regions are underrepresented in this field of research, despite that fact that these countries are highly climate vulnerable, often experience extreme weather events that cause severe damages and have the least capacity to adapt.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, a South Asian country with tropical monsoon climate, is a hotspot of climate change impacts as it is vulnerable to a combination of increasing challenges from record-breaking temperatures, extreme rainfall events, more intense river floods, tropical cyclones, and rising sea levels. The unique geographical location of this country particularly exposes it to high risks of flooding and landslides caused by heavy rainfall events. Observation based studies indicate that the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events may have already increased, with significant repercussions for agriculture, health, ecosystems and economic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using high resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations from weather@home, here we quantify the risks of extreme rainfall events in Bangladesh under pre-industrial, present-day and future climate scenarios of the Paris Agreement temperature targets of 1.5&amp;#176;C and 2&amp;#176;C warming. Additionally, we assess the risks under greenhouse gas (GHG)-only climate scenario where anthropogenic aerosols are reduced to pre-industrial levels. In order to test the robustness of the RCM results, available four atmosphere only global circulation model (AGCM) simulations from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project are analysed. This enabled for the first time, a multi-model assessment of the changing risks of extreme rainfall events in Bangladesh considering anthropogenic climate change drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that both a 1.5&amp;#176;C and 2.0&amp;#176;C warmer world is poised to experience increased seasonal mean and, to a lesser extent, increased extreme rainfall events. The risk of a 1 in 100 year rainfall event under current climate condition has already increased significantly compared with pre-industrial levels. Substantial reduction in the impacts resulting from 1.5&amp;#176;C compared with 2&amp;#176;C warming is reported in this study; however the difference is spatially and temporally variable across Bangladesh. This paper highlights that reduction in the anthropogenic aerosols play an important role in determining the overall future climate change impacts; by exacerbating the effects of GHG induced global warming and thereby increasing the rainfall intensity. The policy-makers therefore need to take stronger climate actions to avoid impacts of 2&amp;#176;C warmer world and consider future changes in the risks of extreme rainfall events in the face of changeable GHG and aerosol impacts.

AB  - The development of ensemble-based ‘probabilistic’ climate forecasts is often seen as a promising avenue for climate scientists. Ensemble-based methods allow scientists to produce more informative, nuanced forecasts of climate variables by reflecting uncertainty from various sources, such as similarity to observation and model uncertainty. However, these developments present challenges as well as opportunities, particularly surrounding issues of experimental design and interpretation of forecast results. This paper discusses different approaches and attempts to set out what climate

AB  - Abstract. A new climate modelling project has been developed for regional climate simulation and the attribution of weather and climate extremes over Australia and New Zealand. The project, known as weather@home Australia–New Zealand, uses public volunteers' home computers to run a moderate-resolution global atmospheric model with a nested regional model over the Australasian region. By harnessing the aggregated computing power of home computers, weather@home is able to generate an unprecedented number of simulations of possible weather under various climate scenarios. This combination of large ensemble sizes with high spatial resolution allows extreme events to be examined with well-constrained estimates of sampling uncertainty. This paper provides an overview of the weather@home Australia–New Zealand project, including initial evaluation of the regional model performance. The model is seen to be capable of resolving many climate features that are important for the Australian and New Zealand regions, including the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation on driving natural climate variability. To date, 75 model simulations of the historical climate have been successfully integrated over the period 1985–2014 in a time-slice manner. In addition, multi-thousand member ensembles have also been generated for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 under climate scenarios with and without the effect of human influences. All data generated by the project are freely available to the broader research community.

AB  - Abstract. In August 2017 Bangladesh faced one of its worst river flooding events in
recent history. This paper presents, for the first time, an attribution of this
precipitation-induced flooding to anthropogenic climate change from a
combined meteorological and hydrological perspective. Experiments were
conducted with three observational datasets and two climate models to
estimate changes in the extreme 10-day precipitation event frequency over the
Brahmaputra basin up to the present and, additionally, an outlook to 2 ∘C warming since pre-industrial times.
The precipitation fields were then used as meteorological input for four
different hydrological models to estimate the corresponding changes in river
discharge, allowing for comparison between approaches and for the robustness
of the attribution results to be assessed. In all three observational precipitation datasets the climate change trends
for extreme precipitation similar to that observed in August 2017 are not
significant, however in two out of three series, the sign of this
insignificant trend is positive. One climate model ensemble shows a
significant positive influence of anthropogenic climate change, whereas the
other large ensemble model simulates a cancellation between the increase due
to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and a decrease due to sulfate aerosols. Considering
discharge rather than precipitation, the hydrological models show that
attribution of the change in discharge towards higher values is somewhat less
uncertain than in precipitation, but the 95 % confidence intervals still
encompass no change in risk. Extending the analysis to the future, all models
project an increase in probability of extreme events at 2 ∘C global
heating since pre-industrial times, becoming more than 1.7 times more likely
for high 10-day precipitation and being more likely by a factor of about 1.5 for
discharge. Our best estimate on the trend in flooding events similar to the
Brahmaputra event of August 2017 is derived by synthesizing the observational
and model results: we find the change in risk to be greater than 1 and of
a similar order of magnitude (between 1 and 2) for both the meteorological and
hydrological approach. This study shows that, for precipitation-induced
flooding events, investigating changes in precipitation is useful, either as
an alternative when hydrological models are not available or as an
additional measure to confirm qualitative conclusions. Besides this, it highlights
the importance of using multiple models in attribution studies, particularly
where the climate change signal is not strong relative to natural variability
or is confounded by other factors such as aerosols.

AB  - Increasing climate commitments to meet the Paris Agreement goal avoids large numbers of heat-related deaths in U.S. cities.
          , 
            Current greenhouse gas mitigation ambition is consistent with ~3°C global mean warming above preindustrial levels. There is a clear need to strengthen mitigation ambition to stabilize the climate at the Paris Agreement goal of warming of less than 2°C. We specify the differences in city-level heat-related mortality between the 3°C trajectory and warming of 2° and 1.5°C. Focusing on 15 U.S. cities where reliable climate and health data are available, we show that ratcheting up mitigation ambition to achieve the 2°C threshold could avoid between 70 and 1980 annual heat-related deaths per city during extreme events (30-year return period). Achieving the 1.5°C threshold could avoid between 110 and 2720 annual heat-related deaths. Population changes and adaptation investments would alter these numbers. Our results provide compelling evidence for the heat-related health benefits of limiting global warming to 1.5°C in the United States.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;Multi-thousand member climate model simulations are highly valuable for showing how extreme weather events will change as the climate changes, using a physically-based approach. However, until now, studies using such an approach have been limited to using models with a resolution much coarser than the most modern systems. We have developed a global atmospheric model with 5/6&amp;#176;x5/9&amp;#176; resolution (~60km in middle latitudes) that can be run in the climateprediction.net distributed computing system to produce such large datasets. This resolution is finer than that of many current global climate models and sufficient for good simulation of extratropical synoptic features such as storms. It will also allow many extratropical extreme weather events to be simulated without requiring regional downscaling. We will show that this model's simulation of extratropical weather is competitive with that in other current models. We will also present results from the first multi-thousand member ensembles produced at this resolution, showing the impact of 1.5&amp;#176;C and 2&amp;#176;C global warming on extreme winter rainfall and extratropical cyclones in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Abstract. Weather forecasts rely heavily on general circulation models of
the atmosphere and other components of the Earth system. National
meteorological and hydrological services and intergovernmental
organizations, such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), provide routine operational forecasts on a range of
spatio-temporal scales by running these models at high resolution on
state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems. Such operational
forecasts are very demanding in terms of computing resources. To facilitate
the use of a weather forecast model for research and training purposes
outside the operational environment, ECMWF provides a portable version of
its numerical weather forecast model, OpenIFS, for use by universities and
other research institutes on their own computing systems. In this paper, we describe a new project (OpenIFS@home) that combines
OpenIFS with a citizen science approach to involve the general public in
helping conduct scientific experiments. Volunteers from across the world can
run OpenIFS@home on their computers at home, and the results of these
simulations can be combined into large forecast ensembles. The
infrastructure of such distributed computing experiments is based on our
experience and expertise with the climateprediction.net (https://www.climateprediction.net/, last access: 1 June 2021) and
weather@home systems. In order to validate this first use of OpenIFS in a volunteer computing
framework, we present results from ensembles of forecast simulations of
Tropical Cyclone Karl from September 2016 studied during the NAWDEX field
campaign. This cyclone underwent extratropical transition and intensified in
mid-latitudes to give rise to an intense jet streak near Scotland and heavy
rainfall over Norway. For the validation we use a 2000-member
ensemble of OpenIFS run on the OpenIFS@home volunteer framework and a
smaller ensemble of the size of operational forecasts using ECMWF's forecast
model in 2016 run on the ECMWF supercomputer with the same horizontal
resolution as OpenIFS@home. We present ensemble statistics that illustrate
the reliability and accuracy of the OpenIFS@home forecasts and
discuss the use of large ensembles in the context of forecasting extreme
events.

T2  - Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application
AB  - Changes in the Earth's climate have been increasingly observed. Assessing the likelihood that each of these changes has been caused by human influence is important for decision making on mitigation and adaptation policy. Because of their large societal and economic impacts, extreme events have garnered much media attention—have they become more frequent and more intense, and if so, why? To answer such questions, extreme event attribution (EEA) tries to estimate extreme event likelihoods under different scenarios. Over the past decade, statistical methods and experimental designs based on numerical models have been developed, tested, and applied. In this article, we review the basic probability schemes, inference techniques, and statistical hypotheses used in EEA. To implement EEA analysis, the climate community relies on the use of large ensembles of climate model runs. We discuss, from a statistical perspective, how extreme value theory could help to deal with the different modeling uncertainties. In terms of interpretation, we stress that causal counterfactual theory offers an elegant framework that clarifies the design of event attributions. Finally, we pinpoint some remaining statistical challenges, including the choice of the appropriate spatio-temporal scales to enhance attribution power, the modeling of concomitant extreme events in a multivariate context, and the coupling of multi-ensemble and observational uncertainties.

AB  - Abstract
            Summer 2010 saw two simultaneous extremes linked by an atmospheric wave train: a record-breaking heatwave in Russia and severe floods in Pakistan. Here, we study this wave event using a large ensemble climate model experiment. First, we show that the circulation in 2010 reflected a recurrent wave train connecting the heatwave and flooding events. Second, we show that the occurrence of the wave train is favored by three drivers: (1) 2010 sea surface temperature anomalies increase the probability of this wave train by a factor 2-to-4 relative to the model’s climatology, (2) early-summer soil moisture deficit in Russia not only increases the probability of local heatwaves, but also enhances rainfall extremes over Pakistan by forcing an atmospheric wave response, and (3) high-latitude land warming favors wave-train occurrence and therefore rainfall and heat extremes. These findings highlight the complexity and synergistic interactions between different drivers, reconciling some seemingly contradictory results from previous studies.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;Modified frequencies and magnitudes of extreme events due to climate change can have large impacts on societies and are therefore a key area of current research. Large model ensembles are required to quantify and attribute changes to extreme events. Until now, the large ensembles used for such studies are commonly atmosphere-only models forced with time-varying sea surface temperatures (SST) and sea ice.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is very powerful but presents problems of internal physical consistency. In an SST-forced model, the ocean acts as having an infinite heat capacity whereas in the real-world SST emerges dynamically from the interaction of atmospheric and oceanic processes (Dong et al., 2020). This is particularly relevant for the North Atlantic where ocean processes, in particular meridional heat transport, are key drivers of air-sea coupling. A long-standing challenge, however, is the computational cost of spinning up fully coupled atmosphere-ocean models that hinders their application to large-ensemble, high-resolution simulations required to quantify changing hazard frequencies of low-probability events.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work we combine the HadAM4 (Webb et al., 2001) atmospheric model at N144 resolution with a Slab ocean (Hewitt &amp; Mitchell, 1997; Williams et al., 2003), which includes a simple sea ice model, to yield the atmosphere-Slab Ocean model HadSM4. The Slab Ocean is forced with diagnosed heat convergence (Q-Flux) and surface currents for sea ice advection (a useful model-development finding for this kind of experiment is that including sea ice velocity information from reanalyses in the surface current field yields a substantially improved spatial pattern of sea ice). We are therefore able to directly compare SST-forced atmosphere-only runs with Q-Flux-forced runs where SST is an emergent property of the model, specifically accounting for the passive response of SSTs in the North Atlantic. Using the distributed infrastructure of climateprediction.net (Guillod et al., 2017; Massey et al., 2015) we run large ensembles to compare extreme statistics and quantify the importance of fast ocean-atmosphere coupling for extreme event statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We further use this large ensemble setup to investigate the dynamics that drive extreme events from the ocean through air-sea interaction to atmospheric processes. We address is whether and how the slope of a return-time plot (related to the scale parameter of a GEV distribution) is affected by atmosphere-ocean interactions, since this statistic plays a central role in determining relative-risk estimates in event attribution studies. We then investigate how a perturbation to the Q-Flux, representing a change in ocean heat transport, propagates through the system and alters the statistics of extreme events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dong et al., 2020, Climate Dynamics, 55(5&amp;#8211;6), 1225&amp;#8211;1245.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guillod et al., 2017, Geoscientific Model Development, 10(5), 1849&amp;#8211;1872.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewitt &amp; Mitchell, 1997, Climate Dynamics, 13(11), 821&amp;#8211;834.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massey et al., 2015, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 141(690), 1528&amp;#8211;1545.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webb et al., 2001, Climate Dynamics, 17(12), 905&amp;#8211;922.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams et al., 2003, Climate Dynamics, 20(7&amp;#8211;8), 705&amp;#8211;721.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Abstract
            The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and eddy-driven jet contain a forced component arising from sea surface temperature (SST) variations. Due to large amounts of internal variability, it is not trivial to determine where and to what extent SSTs force the NAO and jet. A linear statistical–dynamic method is employed with a large climate ensemble to compute the sensitivities of the winter and summer NAO and jet speed and latitude to the SSTs. Key regions of sensitivity are identified in the Indian and Pacific basins, and the North Atlantic tripole. Using the sensitivity maps and a long observational SST dataset, skillful reconstructions of the NAO and jet time series are made. The ability to skillfully forecast both the winter and summer NAO using only SST anomalies is also demonstrated. The linear approach used here allows precise attribution of model forecast signals to SSTs in particular regions. Skill comes from the Atlantic and Pacific basins on short lead times, while the Indian Ocean SSTs may contribute to the longer-term NAO trend. However, despite the region of high sensitivity in the Indian Ocean, SSTs here do not provide significant skill on interannual time scales, which highlights the limitations of the imposed SST approach. Given the impact of the NAO and jet on Northern Hemisphere weather and climate, these results provide useful information that could be used for improved attribution and forecasting.

AB  - Abstract. Hydro-meteorological extremes such as drought and heavy precipitation can
have large impacts on society and the economy. With potentially increasing
risks associated with such events due to climate change, properly assessing
the associated impacts and uncertainties is critical for adequate adaptation.
However, the application of risk-based approaches often requires large sets
of extreme events, which are not commonly available. Here, we present such a
large set of hydro-meteorological time series for recent past and future
conditions for the United Kingdom based on weather@home 2, a modelling
framework consisting of a global climate model (GCM) driven by observed or
projected sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice which is downscaled to
25 km over the European domain by a regional climate model (RCM). Sets of
100 time series are generated for each of (i) a historical baseline
(1900–2006), (ii) five near-future scenarios (2020–2049) and
(iii) five far-future scenarios
(2070–2099). The five scenarios in each future time slice all follow the
Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and sample the range of sea
surface temperature and sea ice changes from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) models. Validation of the
historical baseline highlights good performance for temperature and potential
evaporation, but substantial seasonal biases in mean precipitation, which are
corrected using a linear approach. For extremes in low precipitation over a
long accumulation period (>3 months) and shorter-duration high
precipitation (1–30 days), the time series generally represents past
statistics well. Future projections show small precipitation increases in
winter but large decreases in summer on average, leading to an overall
drying, consistently with the most recent UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) but
larger in magnitude than the latter. Both drought and high-precipitation
events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity in most regions,
highlighting the need for appropriate adaptation measures. Overall, the
presented dataset is a useful tool for assessing the risk associated with
drought and more generally with hydro-meteorological extremes in the UK.

AB  - Large data sets created within the MaRIUS project (Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity). Three time periods are covered: historical baseline (BS: 1900-2006), near-future (NF: 2020-2049) and far-future (FF: 2070-2099), whereby the RCP8.5 is assumed for future time slices. The 30-year baseline to which future time slices should be compared to are years 2075-2004 of the historical baseline, since oceanic variability in future time slices is based on these years. One set of 100 time series is available for the historical baseline, while 5 sets of about 85-100 time series are available for each future time slice. The five sets sample climate model uncertainty by sampling a range of sea surface temperature warming patterns as follows: nf and ff use the median warming pattern of CMIP5 climate models. The four others sets are called nf-pYYz (near future) and ff-pYYz (far future) whereby 'YY' stands for the percentile of global mean SST warming (YY=10 or 90) and 'z' stands for the North Atlantic SST gradient (z=n for minimum, z=x for maximum). All natural forcings (e.g., volcanoes) in the future time slices are replications of years 1975-2004, while anthropogenic forcings (e.g., CO2 concentrations) follow the high-emission scenario RCP8.5. The time series were created from single-year simulations that have been stitched together while ensuring continuity in the slowly-evolving variability (see Guillod et al., Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 2017 for details). Therefore, for each set (e.g., near_future_p10n), a 'stitching table' is provided alongside with data from individual yearly simulations, which contains the simulation ID ('umid') for each year and each individual time series (i.e., each column within the table list the umid for each year of the time series). Data are gridded NetCDF V3 files, provided on a rotated longitude-latitude grid at a 0.22 degree resolution (European CORDEX grid) over a domain encompassing the United Kingdom. A subset of variables are available at daily, 5-days, and monthly temporal resolutions, based on a calendar with 360 days a year (30 days per month). Included are only data from HadRM3P, the regional climate model within weather@home2. After unpacking yearly *tgz files for a given time slice and scenario (e.g., near_future_p10n) within a directory with the relevant name, the data are structured as follows: timeslice / year / umid / temporalResolution / WAH_umid_variable_temporalResolution_g2_year.nc where: - The temporal resolution ('temporalResolution') available depends on the variable, but it can be 'daily', 'monthly', or '5days' - 'timeslice' can be one of: 'baseline', 'near_future', 'near_future_p10n', 'near_future_p10x', 'near_future_p90n', 'near_future_p90x', 'far_future', 'far_future_p10n', 'far_future_p10x', 'far_future_p90n', 'far_future_p90x'. - 'year' is the year of the simulation and data. - 'umid' is the ID of the simulation, to be read from the stitching table. - 'variable' is the variable, following CMOR conventions (see also Table 3 in Guillod et al., Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 2017). Further details about the data, including validation of the climate time series and analyses of some changes in the future projections, can be found in the PDF documentation as well as in Guillod et al., 2017b. A detailed validation of the model (weather@home2) can be found in Guillod et al., 2017a (see list of references below).

AB  - Predictions of future climate are of central importance in determining actions to adapt to the impacts of climate change and in formulating targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In the absence of analogues of the future, physically based numerical climate models must be used to make predictions. New approaches are under development to deal with a number of sources of uncertainty that arise in the prediction process. This paper introduces some of the concepts and issues in these new approaches, which are discussed in more detail in the papers contained in this issue.

AB  - This article describes the field of the detection and attribution of climate change and highlights recent progress, major issues, and future directions. The attribution of global temperature variations over the past century to a combination of anthropogenic and natural influences is now well established, with the anthropogenic factors dominating. Other aspects of the climate system, including regional quantities, are increasingly being found to also show a detectable signal of human influence. Of particular interest, though, is the attribution of changes in nonmeteorological quantities, such as hydrological and ecological measures, and of changes in the risk of extreme weather events to anthropogenic emissions. Methods are being developed for tackling these two problems but are still in the early stages. As the field gradually includes a service focus, the biggest challenges will become the integration of various approaches into an overall framework and the communication of the capabilities and limitations of that framework to the outside community.

AB  - Perturbed physics experiments are among the most comprehensive ways to address uncertainty in climate change forecasts. In these experiments, parameters and parametrizations in atmosphere–ocean general circulation models are perturbed across ranges of uncertainty, and results are compared with observations. In this paper, we describe the largest perturbed physics climate experiment conducted to date, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) climate change experiment, in which the physics of the atmosphere and ocean are changed, and run in conjunction with a forcing ensemble designed to represent uncertainty in past and future forcings, under the A1B Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) climate change scenario.

AB  - Tropical rainforests in Africa are one of the most under-researched regions in the world, but research in the Amazonian rainforest suggests potential vulnerability to climate change. Using the large ensemble of Atmosphere-only general circulation model (AGCM) simulations within the weather@home project, statistics of precipitation in the dry season of the Congo Basin rainforest are analysed. By validating the model simulation against observations, we could identify a good model performance for the June, July, August (JJA) dry season, but this result does need to be taken with caution as observed data are of poor quality. Additional validation methods have been used to investigate the applicability of probabilistic event attribution analysis from large model ensembles to a tropical region, in this case the Congo Basin. These methods corroborate the confidence in the model, leading us to believe the attribution result to be robust. That is, that there are no significant changes in the risk of low precipitation extremes during this dry season (JJA) precipitation in the Congo Basin. Results for the December, January, February dry season are less clear. The study highlights that attribution analysis has the potential to provide valuable scientific evidence of recent or anticipated climatological changes, especially in regions with sparse observational data and unclear projections of future changes. However, the strong influence of sea surface temperature teleconnection patterns on tropical precipitation provides more challenges in the set up of attribution studies than midlatitude rainfall.

            The emergence of clear semantics for causal claims and of a sound logic for causal reasoning is relatively recent, with the consolidation over the past decades of a coherent theoretical corpus of definitions, concepts, and methods of general applicability that is anchored into counterfactuals. The latter corpus has proved to be of high practical interest in numerous applied fields (e.g., epidemiology, economics, and social science). In spite of their rather consensual nature and proven efficacy, these definitions and methods are to a large extent not used in detection and attribution (D&A). This article gives a brief overview of the main concepts underpinning the causal theory and proposes some methodological extensions for the causal attribution of weather and climate-related events that are rooted into the latter. Implications for the formulation of causal claims and their uncertainty are finally discussed.

AB  - Abstract
            Recent extreme weather events and their impacts on societies have highlighted the need for timely adaptation to the changing odds of their occurrence. Such measures require appropriate information about likely changes in event frequency and magnitude on relevant spatiotemporal scales. However, to support robust climate information for decision-making, an effective communication between scientists and stakeholders is crucial. In this context, weather event attribution studies are increasingly raising attention beyond academic circles, although the understanding of how to take it beyond academia is still evolving. This paper presents the results of a study that involved in-depth interviews with stakeholders from a range of sectors about potential applications and the general usefulness of event attribution studies. A case study of the hot and dry summer 2012 in southeast Europe is used as a concrete example, with a focus on the applicability of attribution results across sectors. An analysis of the interviews reveals an abundant interest among the interviewed stakeholders and highlights the need for information on the causes and odds of extreme events, in particular on regional scales. From this data key aspects of stakeholder engagement are emerging, which could productively feed back into how probabilistic event attribution studies are designed and communicated to ensure practical relevance and usefulness for the stakeholder community.

AB  - Abstract
            Computing resources donated by volunteers have generated the first superensemble of regional climate model results, in which the Hadley Centre Regional Model, version 3P (HadRM3P), and Hadley Centre Atmosphere Model, version 3P (HadAM3P), were implemented for the western United States at 25-km resolution. Over 136,000 valid and complete 1-yr runs have been generated to date: about 126,000 for 1960–2009 using observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and 10,000 for 2030–49 using projected SSTs from a global model simulation. Ensemble members differ in initial conditions, model physics, and (potentially, for future runs) SSTs. This unprecedented confluence of high spatial resolution and large ensemble size allows high signal-to-noise ratio and more robust estimates of uncertainty. This paper describes the experiment, compares model output with observations, shows select results for climate change simulations, and gives examples of the strength of the large ensemble size.

AB  - Abstract. Understanding, quantifying and attributing the impacts of extreme weather and climate events in the terrestrial biosphere is crucial for societal adaptation in a changing climate. However, climate model simulations generated for this purpose typically exhibit biases in their output that hinder any straightforward assessment of impacts. To overcome this issue, various bias correction strategies are routinely used to alleviate climate model deficiencies, most of which have been criticized for physical inconsistency and the nonpreservation of the multivariate correlation structure. In this study, we introduce a novel, resampling-based bias correction scheme that fully preserves the physical consistency and multivariate correlation structure of the model output. This procedure strongly improves the representation of climatic extremes and variability in a large regional climate model ensemble (HadRM3P, climateprediction.net/weatherathome), which is illustrated for summer extremes in temperature and rainfall over Central Europe. Moreover, we simulate biosphere–atmosphere fluxes of carbon and water using a terrestrial ecosystem model (LPJmL) driven by the bias-corrected climate forcing. The resampling-based bias correction yields strongly improved statistical distributions of carbon and water fluxes, including the extremes. Our results thus highlight the importance of carefully considering statistical moments beyond the mean for climate impact simulations. In conclusion, the present study introduces an approach to alleviate climate model biases in a physically consistent way and demonstrates that this yields strongly improved simulations of climate extremes and associated impacts in the terrestrial biosphere. A wider uptake of our methodology by the climate and impact modelling community therefore seems desirable for accurately quantifying changes in past, current and future extremes.

AB  - Abstract. Understanding the unfolding challenges of climate change relies on climate models, many of which have large summer warm and dry biases over Northern Hemisphere continental midlatitudes. This work, with the example of the model used in the updated version of the weather@home distributed climate model framework, shows the potential for improving climate model simulations through a multiphased parameter refinement approach, particularly over the northwestern United States (NWUS). Each phase consists of (1) creating a perturbed parameter ensemble with the coupled global–regional atmospheric model, (2) building statistical emulators that estimate climate metrics as functions of parameter values, (3) and using the emulators to further refine the parameter space. The refinement process includes sensitivity analyses to identify the most influential parameters for various model output metrics; results are then used to cull parameters with little influence. Three phases of this iterative process are carried out before the results are considered to be satisfactory; that is, a handful of parameter sets are identified that meet acceptable bias reduction criteria. Results not only indicate that 74 % of the NWUS regional warm biases can be reduced by refining global atmospheric parameters that control convection and hydrometeor transport, as well as land surface parameters that affect plant photosynthesis, transpiration, and evaporation, but also suggest that this iterative approach to perturbed parameters has an important role to play in the evolution of physical parameterizations.

AB  - Abstract. Extreme weather events can have large impacts on society and, in many regions, are expected to change in frequency and intensity with climate change. Owing to the relatively short observational record, climate models are useful tools as they allow for generation of a larger sample of extreme events, to attribute recent events to anthropogenic climate change, and to project changes in such events into the future. The modelling system known as weather@home, consisting of a global climate model (GCM) with a nested regional climate model (RCM) and driven by sea surface temperatures, allows one to generate a very large ensemble with the help of volunteer distributed computing. This is a key tool to understanding many aspects of extreme events. Here, a new version of the weather@home system (weather@home 2) with a higher-resolution RCM over Europe is documented and a broad validation of the climate is performed. The new model includes a more recent land-surface scheme in both GCM and RCM, where subgrid-scale land-surface heterogeneity is newly represented using tiles, and an increase in RCM resolution from 50 to 25 km. The GCM performs similarly to the previous version, with some improvements in the representation of mean climate. The European RCM temperature biases are overall reduced, in particular the warm bias over eastern Europe, but large biases remain. Precipitation is improved over the Alps in summer, with mixed changes in other regions and seasons. The model is shown to represent the main classes of regional extreme events reasonably well and shows a good sensitivity to its drivers. In particular, given the improvements in this version of the weather@home system, it is likely that more reliable statements can be made with regards to impact statements, especially at more localized scales.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;Summer 2010 was characterized by two contemporaneous extreme events: the Russian heat wave and the Pakistan flood. Several studies have shown a link between the two events, and Quasi-Resonant Amplification (QRA) has been suggested as an atmosphere-dynamic mechanism leading to the anomalous wavy circulation pattern which connected both extremes. Here, we aim at reproducing the 2010 circulation conditions in the Northern Hemisphere by obtaining a large ensemble of simulations from the Weather@home project within climateprediction.net (CPDN). We identify those ensemble members exhibiting a specific latitudinal temperature profile characterised by amplified high-latitude land warming (QRA - fingerprint) and investigate their surface temperature and upper level circulation properties. We show that when the QRA - fingerprint is present, the mid-latitude circulation bears similar characteristics to those observed in the 2010 summer: hot temperatures over European Russia and a wavy pattern in the upper-tropospheric meridional winds. As temperature profiles are projected to become increasingly similar to the QRA-fingerprint under future emission scenarios, these results provide further evidence that high latitude warming might favour persistent surface weather in the mid-latitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Cloud computing is a mature technology that has already shown benefits for a wide range of academic research domains that, in turn, utilize a wide range of application design models. In this paper, we discuss the use of cloud computing as a tool to improve the range of resources available for climate science, presenting the evaluation of two different climate models. Each was customized in a different way to run in public cloud computing environments (hereafter cloud computing) provided by three different public vendors: Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The adaptations and procedures necessary to run the models in these environments are described. The computational performance and cost of each model within this new type of environment are discussed, and an assessment is given in qualitative terms. Finally, we discuss how cloud computing can be used for geoscientific modelling, including issues related to the allocation of resources by funding bodies. We also discuss problems related to computing security, reliability and scientific reproducibility.

              This study investigates the future changes in dangerous extreme precipitation event in South America, using the multi-model ensemble simulations from the HAPPI experiments. The risks of dangerous extreme precipitation events occurrence, and changes in area and population exposure are quantified. Our results show that the likelihood of dangerous extreme precipitation increases in large parts of South America under future warming; changes in extreme precipitation are nonlinear with increasing global mean temperatures; and exposure plays a minor role compared to hazard. In all the models, limiting warming to 1.5

              C as opposed to 2
              °
              C shows a general reduction in both area and population exposure to dangerous extreme precipitation throughout South America. The southeast region of South America exhibited the highest multi-model median percentage of avoided area exposure at 13.3%, while the southwest region shows the lowest percentage at 3.1%. Under all shared socioeconomic pathways, South America Monsoon region and southern South America region yielded the highest multi-model median percentage of avoided population exposure (>10%). The strong spatial heterogeneity in projected changes in all the models highlights the importance of considering location-specific information when designing adaptation measures and investing in disaster preparedness.

AB  - Any attempt to estimate climate sensitivity using observations requires a set of models or model-versions that simultaneously predict both climate sensitivity and some observable quantity(-ies) given a range of values of unknown climate system properties, represented by choices of parameters, subsystems or even entire models. The choices researchers make with respect to these unknown properties play a crucial role in conditioning their climate forecasts. We show that any probabilistic estimate of climate sensitivity, and hence of the risk that a given greenhouse gas stabilisation level might result in a “dangerous” equilibrium warming, is critically dependent on subjective prior assumptions of the investigators, not simply on constraints provided by actual climate observations. This apparent arbitrariness can be resolved by focussing on the intended purpose of the forecast: while uncertainty in long-term equilibrium warming remains high, an objectively determined 10–90% (5–95%) range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is relevant to forecasts of 21st century transient warming under nearly all current emission scenarios is 1.4–4.1°C with a median of 2.4°C, in good agreement with the “traditional” range.

AB  - In complex spatial models, as used to predict the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions, parameter variation within plausible bounds has major effects on model behavior of interest. Here, we present an unprecedentedly large ensemble of >57,000 climate model runs in which 10 parameters, initial conditions, hardware, and software used to run the model all have been varied. We relate information about the model runs to large-scale model behavior (equilibrium sensitivity of global mean temperature to a doubling of carbon dioxide). We demonstrate that effects of parameter, hardware, and software variation are detectable, complex, and interacting. However, we find most of the effects of parameter variation are caused by a small subset of parameters. Notably, the entrainment coefficient in clouds is associated with 30% of the variation seen in climate sensitivity, although both low and high values can give high climate sensitivity. We demonstrate that the effect of hardware and software is small relative to the effect of parameter variation and, over the wide range of systems tested, may be treated as equivalent to that caused by changes in initial conditions. We discuss the significance of these results in relation to the design and interpretation of climate modeling experiments and large-scale modeling more generally.

AB  - A methodology for constraining climate forecasts, developed for application to the multithousand member perturbed physics ensemble of simulations completed by the distributed computing project ClimatePrediction.net, is here presented in detail. The methodology is extended to produce constrained forecasts of mean surface temperature and precipitation within 21 land-based regions and is validated with climate simulations from other models available from the IPCC (AR4) data set. The mean forecasted values of temperature and precipitation largely confirm prior results for the same regions. In particular, precipitation in the Mediterranean basin is shown to decrease and temperature over northern Europe is shown to increase with comparatively little uncertainty in the forecast (i.e., with tight constraints). However, in some cases the forecasts show large uncertainty, and there are a few cases where the forecasts cannot be constrained at all. These results illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology and its applicability to regional climate variables.

AB  - The quantification of uncertainty is an increasingly popular topic, with clear importance for climate change policy. However, uncertainty assessments are open to a range of interpretations, each of which may lead to a different policy recommendation. In the EQUIP project researchers from the UK climate modelling, statistical modelling, and impacts communities worked together on ‘end-to-end’ uncertainty assessments of climate change and its impacts. Here, we use an experiment in peer review amongst project members to assess variation in the assessment of uncertainties between EQUIP researchers. We find overall agreement on key sources of uncertainty but a large variation in the assessment of the methods used for uncertainty assessment. Results show that communication aimed at specialists makes the methods used harder to assess. There is also evidence of individual bias, which is partially attributable to disciplinary backgrounds. However, varying views on the methods used to quantify uncertainty did not preclude consensus on the consequential results produced using those methods. Based on our analysis, we make recommendations for developing and presenting statements on climate and its impacts. These include the use of a common uncertainty reporting format in order to make assumptions clear; presentation of results in terms of processes and trade-offs rather than only numerical ranges; and reporting multiple assessments of uncertainty in order to elucidate a more complete picture of impacts and their uncertainties. This in turn implies research should be done by teams of people with a range of backgrounds and time for interaction and discussion, with fewer but more comprehensive outputs in which the range of opinions is recorded.

AB  - This study assesses the existence and importance of trends in the spread of South African climate simulations covering 50 years of a large initial-condition ensemble from a dynamical atmospheric model. It quantifies ensemble spread using two contrasting measures – standard deviation and 10–90th percentile range. The study then evaluates and examines the characteristics of long-term trends in the ensemble spread in relation to trends in the ensemble mean and in the observational record, by considering the skill of the monthly mean precipitation and near surface air temperature simulations. Results provide evidence that variations in ensemble spreads generated by the atmospheric model used in this study reflect fundamental properties of atmospheric variability in the real climate system. We find significant long-term trends in the measures of spread, with a general coastal–inland gradient, suggesting the possibility of existence of interannual variations in the potential range of seasonal climate simulations over South Africa. We also find robust relationships between trends in the observational record, in the simulated ensemble means and in measures of the simulated ensemble spread. Irrespective of the direction of trends, the correspondence of higher model skill when trends in the ensemble spread are larger suggests that the skill produced by a dynamical modelling system may not be independent of the model ability to capture the real atmospheric trends in whatever the model is simulating or forecasting. Therefore, based on historical data, further understanding of how potential predictability is changing has the prospect to improve the interpretation of current estimates of simulation skill.

AB  - Abstract Simulations from a regional climate model (RCM) as part of a superensemble experiment were compared with observations of surface meteorological variables over the western United States. The RCM is the Hadley Centre Regional Climate Model, version 3, with improved physics parameterizations (HadRM3P) run at 25-km resolution and nested within the Hadley Centre Atmosphere Model, version 3 (HadAM3P). Overall, the means of seasonal temperature were well represented in the simulations; 95% of grid points were within 2.7°, 2.4°, and 3.6°C of observations in winter, spring, and summer, respectively. The model was too warm over most of the domain in summer except central California and southern Nevada. HadRM3P produced more extreme temperatures than observed. The overall magnitude and spatial pattern of precipitation were well characterized, though HadRM3P exaggerated the orographic enhancement along the coastal mountains, Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. HadRM3P produced warm/dry northwest, cool/wet southwest U.S. patterns associated with El Niño. However, there were notable differences, including the locations of the transition from warm (dry) to cool (wet) in the anomaly fields when compared with observations, though there was disagreement among observations. HadRM3P simulated the observed spatial pattern of mean annual temperature more faithfully than any of the RCM–GCM pairings in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Errors in mean annual precipitation from HadRM3P fell within the range of errors of the NARCCAP models. Last, this paper provided examples of the size of an ensemble required to detect changes at the local level and demonstrated the effect of parameter perturbation on regional precipitation.

AB  - Climateprediction.net (CPDN) is a distributed initiative that aims to run thousands of different climate modeling simulations in order to research the uncertainties on parameters, which is needed to be able to understand how small variations in initital values can affect both models and results of simulated climate. CPDN has been running for more than 10 years and nowadays it is facing a set of new different challenges: • Growing and variable need for new resources, caused by the execution and outputs of new versions of the model (HadGEM) [2] and the processing of huge amount or results that are hard to manage with the current infrastructure that runs over the BOINC framework. • Lack, and need, of more control over the workflow and its intermediate stages. • Streamlining of the costs and budget. This is of special interest for research on-demand projects increasingly requested by external research collaborators and stakeholders.

AB  - Droughts and related water scarcity can have large impacts on societies and consist of interactions between a number of natural and human factors. Meteorological conditions are usually the first natural trigger of droughts, and climate change is expected to impact these and thereby the frequency and intensity of the events. However, extreme events such as droughts are, by definition, rare, and accurately quantifying the risk related to such events is therefore difficult. The MaRIUS project (Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity) aims at quantifying the risks associated with droughts in the UK under present and future conditions. To do so, a large number of drought events, from climate model simulations downscaled at 25km over Europe, are being fed into hydrological models of various complexity and used for the estimation of drought risk associated with human and natural systems, including impacts on the economy, industry, agriculture, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and socio-cultural aspects. Here, we present the hydro-meteorological drought event set that has been produced by weather@home [1] for MaRIUS. Using idle processor time on volunteers' computers around the world, we have run a very large number (10'000s) of Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations, downscaled at 25km over Europe by a nested Regional Climate Model (RCM). Simulations include the past 100 years as well as two future horizons (2030s and 2080s), and provide a large number of sequences of spatio-temporally consistent weather, which are consistent with the boundary forcing such as the ocean, greenhouse gases and solar forcing. The drought event set for use in impact studies is constructed by extracting sequences of dry conditions from these model runs, leading to several thousand drought events. In addition to describing methodological and validation aspects of the synthetic drought event sets, we provide insights into drought risk in the UK, its meteorological drivers, and how it can be expected to change in the future. Finally, we assess the applicability of this methodology to other regions. [1] Massey, N. et al., 2014, Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc.

TI  - Changing population dynamics and uneven temperature emergence combine to exacerbate regional exposure to heat extremes under 1.5 °C and 2 °C of warming

AB  - Understanding how continuing increases in global mean temperature will exacerbate societal exposure to extreme weather events is a question of profound importance. However, determining population exposure to the impacts of heat extremes at 1.5 °C and 2 °C of global mean warming requires not only (1) a robust understanding of the physical climate system response, but also consideration of (2) projected changes to overall population size, as well as (3) changes to where people will live in the future. This analysis introduces a new framework, adapted from studies of probabilistic event attribution, to disentangle the relative importance of regional climate emergence and changing population dynamics in the exposure to future heat extremes across multiple densely populated regions in Southern Asia and Eastern Africa (SAEA). Our results reveal that, when population is kept at 2015 levels, exposure to heat considered severe in the present decade across SAEA will increase by a factor of 4.1 (2.4–9.6) and 15.8 (5.0–135) under a 1.5°- and 2.0°-warmer world, respectively. Furthermore, projected population changes by the end of the century under an SSP1 and SSP2 scenario can further exacerbate these changes by a factor of 1.2 (1.0–1.3) and 1.5 (1.3–1.7), respectively. However, a large fraction of this additional risk increase is not related to absolute increases in population, but instead attributed to changes in which regions exhibit continued population growth into the future. Further, this added impact of population redistribution will be twice as significant after 2.0 °C of warming, relative to stabilisation at 1.5 °C, due to the non-linearity of increases in heat exposure. Irrespective of the population scenario considered, continued African population expansion will place more people in locations where emergent changes to future heat extremes are exceptionally severe.

AB  - On 21–25 July 2017 a record-breaking heatwave occurred in Central Eastern China, affecting nearly half of the national population and causing severe impacts on public health, agriculture and infrastructure. Here, we compare attribution results from two UK Met Office Hadley Centre models, HadGEM3-GA6 and weather@home (HadAM3P driving 50 km HadRM3P). Within HadGEM3-GA6 July 2017-like heatwaves were unequaled in the ensemble representing the world without human influences. Such heatwaves became approximately a 1 in 50 year event and increased by a factor of 4.8 (5%–95% range of 3.1 to 8.0) in weather@home as a result of human activity. Considering the risk ratio (RR) for the full range of return periods shows a discrepancy at all return times between the two model results. Within weather@home a range of different counterfactual sea surface temperature (SST) patterns were used, whereas HadGEM3-GA6 used a single estimate. The global mean difference in SST (between factual and counterfactual simulations) is shown to be related to the generalised extreme value (GEV) location parameter and consequently the RR, especially for return periods of less than 50 years. It is suggested that a suitable range of SST patterns are used for future attribution studies to ensure that this source of uncertainty is represented within the simulations and subsequent attribution results. It is shown that the risk change between factual and counterfactual simulations is not purely a simple shift in the distribution (i.e. change in GEV location parameter). For return periods greater than 50 years, the GEV shape parameter is found to strongly influence the RR determined with the GEV scale parameter affecting only the most severe events.

AB  - This study investigates the potential influences of anthropogenic forcings and natural variability on the risk of summer extreme temperatures over China. We use three multi-thousand-member ensemble simulations with different forcings (with or without anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions) to evaluate the human impact, and with sea surface temperature patterns from three different years around the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 2015/16 event (years 2014, 2015 and 2016) to evaluate the impact of natural variability. A generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is used to fit the ensemble results. Based on these model results, we find that, during the peak of ENSO (2015), daytime extreme temperatures are smaller over the central China region compared to a normal year (2014). During 2016, the risk of nighttime extreme temperatures is largely increased over the eastern coastal region. Both anomalies are of the same magnitude as the anthropogenic influence. Thus, ENSO can amplify or counterbalance (at a regional and annual scale) anthropogenic effects on extreme summer temperatures over China. Changes are mainly due to changes in the GEV location parameter. Thus, anomalies are due to a shift in the distributions and not to a change in temperature variability.

AB  - Hydrological simulations derived from future climate projections provide valuable tools to quantify potential future changes in hydrological extremes and to inform water resource management decisions. However, estimating future changes in hydrological extremes is challenging as historical and future climate projections are often subject to considerable uncertainties and biases. This can lead to incorrect and biased hydrological projections, especially when propagated through a hydrological model. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of future changes in drought characteristics to potential biases in the forcing data from climate model simulations. To achieve this, a flexible national scale hydrological model, dynamic TOPMODEL, is driven by simulated current and future rainfall and potential evapotranspiration time series from a hydro-meteorological drought event set produced using the weather@home regional climate modelling system. We assess the skill of the climate model to reproduce the frequency, severity and duration of droughts for a historical baseline period (1974 - 2004) by comparing hydrological simulations driven using 100 sequences of spatio-temporally consistent weather from the weather@home drought event set to hydrological simulations driven by observational data. We show how biases in drought characteristics vary spatially and temporally for 43 UK catchments and apply a rainfall bias correction to resolve the seasonal climate model biases. We then run 100 sequences for two future time slices (2030s and 2080s) through the hydrological model using the uncorrected and bias corrected drought event sets to investigate how bias correction affects our interpretation of future changes in drought characteristics across the UK. Finally, we discuss the significance of these results for climate change impact studies focused on hydrological extremes.

AB  - Potential increases in the risk of extreme weather events under climate change can have significant socio-economic impacts at regional levels. These impacts are likely to be particularly high in South Asia where Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries. Regional climate models (RCMs) are valuable tools for studying weather and climate at finer spatial scales than are typically available in global climate models. Quantitative assessment of the likely changes in the risk of extreme events occurring requires very large ensemble simulations due to their rarity. The weather@home setup within the climateprediction.net distributed computing project is capable of providing the necessary very large ensembles at regionally higher resolution, but has only been evaluated over the South Asia region for its representation of seasonal climatological and monthly means. Here, we evaluate how realistically the HadAM3P-HadRM3P model setup of weather@home can reproduce the observed patterns of temperature and rainfall in Bangladesh with focus on the modelled extreme events. Using very large ensembles of regional simulations, we find that there are substantial spatial and temporal variations in rainfall and temperature biases compared with observations. These are highest in the pre-monsoon, which are largely caused by timing issues in the model. Modelled mean monsoon and post-monsoon temperatures are in good agreement with observations, whereas there is a dry bias in the modelled mean monsoon rainfall. The rainfall bias varies both spatially and with the data set used for comparison. Despite of these biases, the model-simulated temperature and rainfall extremes in summer monsoon over Bangladesh are approximately representative of the observed ones. At the wettest parts of northeast Bangladesh, rainfall extremes are underestimated compared to GPCC and APHRODITE but are within the range of CPC observations. Therefore, the weather@home RCM, HadRM3P may provide a sufficiently reliable tool for studying the extreme weather events in Bangladesh.

AB  - To understand whether high temperatures and temperature extremes are important for climate change adaptation in Scotland, we place the 2018 heatwave in the context of past, present, and future climate, and provide a rapid but comprehensive impact analysis. The observed hottest day (d), 5 d, and 30 d period of 2018 and the 5 d period with the warmest nights had return periods of 5–15 years for 1950–2018. The warmest night and the maximum 30 d average nighttime temperature were more unusual with return periods of >30 years. Anthropogenic climate change since 1850 has made all these high-temperature extremes more likely. Higher risk ratios are found for experiments from the CMIP6-generation global climate model HadGEM3-GA6 compared to those from the very-large ensemble system weather@home. Between them, the best estimates of the risk ratios for daytime extremes range between 1.2–2.4, 1.2–2.3, and 1.4–4.0 for the 1, 5, and 30 d averages. For the corresponding nighttime extremes, the values are higher and the ranges wider (1.5- >50, 1.5–5.5, and 1.6- >50). The short-period nighttime extremes were more likely in 2018 than in 2017, suggesting a contribution from year-to-year climate variability to the risk enhancement of extreme temperatures due to anthropogenic effects. Climate projections suggest further substantial increases in the likelihood of 2018 temperatures between now and 2050, and that towards the end of the century every summer might be as hot as 2018. Major negative impacts occurred, especially on rural sectors, while transport and water infrastructure alleviated most impacts by implementing costly special measures. Overall, Scotland could cope with the impacts of the 2018 heatwave. However, given the likelihood increase of high-temperature extremes, uncertainty about consequences of even higher temperatures and/or repeated heatwaves, and substantial costs of preventing negative impacts, we conclude that despite its cool climate, high-temperature extremes are important to consider for climate change adaptation in Scotland.

AB  - Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is evaluated in the ACCESS1.0 General Circulation Model (GCM) with fixed land and sea-surface-temperatures (SST) as well as sea-ice. The 4xCO2 ERF is 8.0 W m−2. In contrast, a typical ERF experiment with only fixed SST and sea-ice gives rise to an ERF of only 7.0 W m−2. This difference arises due to the influence of land warming in the commonly used fixed-SST ERF experimental design, which results in: (i) increased emission of longwave radiation to space from the land surface (−0.45 W m−2) and troposphere (−0.90 W m−2), (ii) reduced land snow-cover and albedo (+0.17 W m−2), (iii) increased water-vapor (+0.49 W m−2), and (iv) a cloud adjustment (−0.26 W m−2) due to reduced stability and cloudiness over land (positive ERF) counteracted by increased lower tropospheric stability and marine cloudiness over oceans (negative ERF). The sum of these radiative adjustments to land warming is to reduce the 4xCO2 ERF in fixed-SST experiments by ∼1.0 W m−2. CO2 stomatal effects are quantified and found to contribute just over half of the land warming effect and adjustments in the fixed-SST ERF experimental design in this model. The basic physical mechanisms in response to land warming are confirmed in a solar ERF experiment. We test various methods that have been proposed to account for land warming in fixed-SST ERFs against our GCM results and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

T2  - Journal of Climate
AB  - Abstract The estimated range of climate sensitivity has remained unchanged for decades, resulting in large uncertainties in long-term projections of future climate under increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Here the multi-thousand-member ensemble of climate model simulations from the climateprediction.net project and a neural network are used to establish a relation between climate sensitivity and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in regional temperature. Most models with high sensitivities are found to overestimate the seasonal cycle compared to observations. A probability density function for climate sensitivity is then calculated from the present-day seasonal cycle in reanalysis and instrumental datasets. Subject to a number of assumptions on the models and datasets used, it is found that climate sensitivity is very unlikely (5% probability) to be either below 1.5–2 K or above about 5–6.5 K, with the best agreement found for sensitivities between 3 and 3.5 K. This range is narrower than most probabilistic estimates derived from the observed twentieth-century warming. The current generation of general circulation models are within that range but do not sample the highest values.

T2  - Water Resources Research
AB  - The majority of climate change impacts and adaptation studies so far have been based on at most a few deterministic realizations of future climate, usually representing different emissions scenarios. Large ensembles of climate models are increasingly available either as ensembles of opportunity or perturbed physics ensembles, providing a wealth of additional data that is potentially useful for improving adaptation strategies to climate change. Because of the novelty of this ensemble information, there is little previous experience of practical applications or of the added value of this information for impacts and adaptation decision making. This paper evaluates the value of perturbed physics ensembles of climate models for understanding and planning public water supply under climate change. We deliberately select water resource models that are already used by water supply companies and regulators on the assumption that uptake of information from large ensembles of climate models will be more likely if it does not involve significant investment in new modeling tools and methods. We illustrate the methods with a case study on the Wimbleball water resource zone in the southwest of England. This zone is sufficiently simple to demonstrate the utility of the approach but with enough complexity to allow a variety of different decisions to be made. Our research shows that the additional information contained in the climate model ensemble provides a better understanding of the possible ranges of future conditions, compared to the use of single-model scenarios. Furthermore, with careful presentation, decision makers will find the results from large ensembles of models more accessible and be able to more easily compare the merits of different management options and the timing of different adaptation. The overhead in additional time and expertise for carrying out the impacts analysis will be justified by the increased quality of the decision-making process. We remark that even though we have focused our study on a water resource system in the United Kingdom, our conclusions about the added value of climate model ensembles in guiding adaptation decisions can be generalized to other sectors and geographical regions.

AB  - Comprehensive global climate models1 are the only tools that account for the complex set of processes which will determine future climate change at both a global and regional level. Planners are typically faced with a wide range of predicted changes from different models of unknown relative quality2,3, owing to large but unquantified uncertainties in the modelling process4. Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5–95 per cent probability range of 2.4–5.4 °C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation5,6.

AB  - Climate change impacts and adaptation assessments have traditionally adopted a scenario-based approach, which precludes an assessment of the relative risks of particular adaptation options. Probabilistic impact assessments, especially if based on a thorough analysis of the uncertainty in an impact forecast system, enable adoption of a risk-based assessment framework. However, probabilistic impacts information is conditional and will change over time. We explore the implications of a probabilistic end-to-end risk-based framework for climate impacts assessment, using the example of water resources in the Thames River, UK. We show that a probabilistic approach provides more informative results that enable the potential risk of impacts to be quantified, but that details of the risks are dependent on the approach used in the analysis.

AB  - Abstract
            The impacts of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and anthropogenic greenhouse gases on the likelihood of extreme drought occurring in the central United States in the year 2012 were investigated using large-ensemble simulations from a global atmospheric climate model. Two sets of experiments were conducted. In the first, the simulated hydroclimate of 2012 was compared to a baseline period (1986–2014) to investigate the impact of SSTs. In the second, the hydroclimate in a world with 2012-level anthropogenic forcing was compared to five “counterfactual” versions of a 2012 world under preindustrial forcing. SST anomalies in 2012 increased the simulated likelihood of an extreme summer precipitation deficit (e.g., the deficit with a 2% exceedance probability) by a factor of 5. The likelihood of an extreme summer soil moisture deficit increased by a similar amount, due in great part to a large spring soil moisture deficit carrying over into summer. An anthropogenic impact on precipitation was detectable in the simulations, doubling the likelihood of what would have been a rainfall deficit with a 2% exceedance probability under preindustrial-level forcings. Despite this reduction in rainfall, summer soil moisture during extreme drought was essentially unaffected by anthropogenic forcing because of 1) evapotranspiration declining roughly one-to-one with a decrease in precipitation due to severe water supply constraint and despite higher evaporative demand and 2) a decrease in stomatal conductance, and therefore a decrease in potential transpiration, with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

AB  - The impacts of climate change are already being observed in a variety of sectors and there is greater clarity that these changes are being caused by human activities, mainly through release of greenhouse gases. In 2005 the UK Government hosted the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change conference to take an in-depth look at the scientific issues associated with climate change. This volume presents findings from the leading international scientists that attended the conference. The topics addressed include critical thresholds and key vulnerabilities of the climate system, impacts on human and natural systems, socioeconomic costs and benefits of emissions pathways, and technological options for meeting different stabilisation levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The volume provides invaluable information for researchers in environmental science, climatology, and atmospheric chemistry, policy-makers in governments and environmental organizations, and scientists and engineers in industry.

AB  - The summer of 2003 was probably the hottest in Europe since at latest ad 15001,2,3,4, and unusually large numbers of heat-related deaths were reported in France, Germany and Italy5. It is an ill-posed question whether the 2003 heatwave was caused, in a simple deterministic sense, by a modification of the external influences on climate—for example, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—because almost any such weather event might have occurred by chance in an unmodified climate. However, it is possible to estimate by how much human activities may have increased the risk of the occurrence of such a heatwave6,7,8. Here we use this conceptual framework to estimate the contribution of human-induced increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and other pollutants to the risk of the occurrence of unusually high mean summer temperatures throughout a large region of continental Europe. Using a threshold for mean summer temperature that was exceeded in 2003, but in no other year since the start of the instrumental record in 1851, we estimate it is very likely (confidence level >90%)9 that human influence has at least doubled the risk of a heatwave exceeding this threshold magnitude.

AB  - Abstract. Disastrous bushfires during the last months of 2019 and January 2020 affected Australia, raising the question to what extent the risk of these fires was exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. To answer the question for southeastern Australia, where fires were particularly severe, affecting people and ecosystems, we use a physically based index of fire weather, the Fire Weather Index; long-term observations of heat and drought; and 11 large ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models. We find large trends in the Fire Weather Index in the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA5) since 1979 and a smaller but significant increase by at least 30 % in the models. Therefore, we find that climate change has induced a higher weather-induced risk of such an extreme fire season. This trend is mainly driven by the increase of temperature extremes. In agreement with previous analyses we find that heat extremes have become more likely by at least a factor of 2 due to the long-term warming trend. However, current climate models overestimate variability and tend to underestimate the long-term trend in these extremes, so the true change in the likelihood of extreme heat could be larger, suggesting that the attribution of the increased fire weather risk is a conservative estimate. We do not find an attributable trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the fire season, September–February. The observations, however, show a weak drying trend in the annual mean. For the 2019/20 season more than half of the July–December drought was driven by record excursions of the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode, factors which are included in the analysis here. The study reveals the complexity of the 2019/20 bushfire event, with some but not all drivers showing an imprint of anthropogenic climate change. Finally, the study concludes with a qualitative review of various vulnerability and exposure factors that each play a role, along with the hazard in increasing or decreasing the overall impact of the bushfires.

AB  - Abstract. Understanding the unfolding challenges of climate change relies on climate models, many of which have large summer warm and dry biases over Northern Hemisphere continental mid-latitudes. This work, using the example of the model used in the updated version of the weather@home distributed climate model framework, shows the potential for improving climate model simulations through a multi-phased parameter refinement approach, particularly over northwestern United States(NWUS). Each phase consists of 1) creating a perturbed physics ensemble with the coupled global – regional atmospheric model, 2) building statistical emulators that estimate climate metrics as functions of parameter values, 3) and using the emulators to further refine the parameter space. The refinement process includes sensitivity analyses to identify the most influential parameters for various model output metrics; results are then used to cull parameters with little influence. Three phases of this iterative process are carried out before the results are considered to be satisfactory; that is, a handful of parameter sets are identified that meet acceptable bias reduction criteria. Results not only indicate that 74 % of the NWUS regional warm biases can be reduced by refining global atmospheric parameters that control convection and hydrometeor transport, and land surface parameters that affect plant photosynthesis, transpiration and evaporation, but also suggest that this iterative approach to perturbed physics has an important role to play in the evolution of physical parameterizations.

AB  - Abstract. In August 2017 Bangladesh faced one of its worst river flooding events in recent history. This paper presents for the first time an attribution of this precipitation-induced flooding from a combined meteorological and hydrological perspective. Experiments were conducted with three observational data sets and two climate models to estimate changes in extreme 10-day precipitation event frequency over the Brahmaputra basin. The precipitation fields were then used as meteorological input for four different hydrological models to estimate the corresponding changes in river discharge, allowing for comparison between approaches and for the robustness of the attribution results to be assessed.  In all three observational precipitation data sets the climate change trends for extreme precipitation similar to observed in August 2017 are not significant, however in two out of three series, the sign of this insignificant trend is positive. One climate model shows a significant positive influence of anthropogenic climate change, whereas the other simulates a cancellation between the increase due to greenhouse gases and a decrease due to sulphate aerosols. Considering discharge rather than precipitation, the hydrological models show that attribution of the change in discharge towards higher values is somewhat less uncertain than for precipitation, but the 95 % confidence interval still encompasses no change in risk. For the future, all models project an increase in probability of extreme events at 2 °C global heating since pre-industrial times, becoming more than 1.7 times more likely for high 10-day precipitation, and about a factor 1.5 more likely for discharge. Our best estimate on the trend in flooding events similar to the Brahmaputra event of August 2017 is derived by synthesizing the observational and model results: We find the change in risk to be greater than one and of similar order of magnitude (between 1 and 2) for both the meteorological and hydrological approach. This study shows that, for precipitation-induced flooding events, investigating changes in precipitation is useful, either as an alternative when hydrological models are not available, or as an additional measure to confirm qualitative conclusions. Besides, it highlights the importance of using multiple models in attribution studies, particularly where the climate change signal is not strong relative to natural variability or is confounded by other factors such as aerosols.

AB  - A very large ensemble is used to identify subgrid-scale parameter settings for the HadCM3 model that are capable of best simulating the ocean state over the recent past (1980–2010). A simple particle filtering technique based upon the agreement of basin mean sea surface temperature (SST) and upper 700-m ocean heat content with EN3 observations is applied to an existing perturbed physics ensemble with initial conditions perturbations. A single set of subgrid-scale parameter values was identified from the wide range of initial parameter sets that gave the best agreement with ocean observations for the period studied. The parameter set, different from the standard model parameters, has a transient climate response of 1.68 K. The selected parameter set shows an improved agreement with EN3 decadal-mean SST patterns and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) at 26°N as measured by the Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) array. Particle filtering techniques as demonstrated here could have a useful role in improving the starting point for traditional model-tuning exercises in coupled climate models.

AB  - Volunteer or crowd computing is becoming increasingly popular for solving complex research problems from an increasingly diverse range of areas. The majority of these have been built using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform, which provides a range of different services to manage all computation aspects of a project. The BOINC system is ideal in those cases where not only does the research community involved need low-cost access to massive computing resources but also where there is a significant public interest in the research being done.

We discuss the way in which cloud services can help BOINC-based projects to deliver results in a fast, on demand manner. This is difficult to achieve using volunteers, and at the same time, using scalable cloud resources for short on demand projects can optimize the use of the available resources. We show how this design can be used as an efficient distributed computing platform within the cloud, and outline new approaches that could open up new possibilities in this field, using Climateprediction.net (http://www.climateprediction.net/) as a case study.
