AB  - As we, the ICCM community, continue to expand the scope of our cognitive modeling ambitions, we increasingly face computational requirements that are an impediment to progress. Computational complexity grows quickly with increases in the granularity of models, the fidelity of the models operating environment, and the time scales across which these models interact. Additional processing demands are encountered when studying the breadth of a cognitive models performance capabilities such as through observing the models sustained fitness while varying the environment or conducting sensitivity analyses of interactions between internal model parameters in a controlled experiments. Such computational demands are not unique to the cognitive modeling community. Other scientific fields bioinformatics, meteorology, physics, etc. have already pioneered a variety of platforms and methodologies for dealing with similarly computationally complex problems. We will achieve faster progress toward the broader scientific objectives of cognitive modeling and the specific goals of particular research projects if we pay attention to the lessons learned and capabilities developed in other computational sciences.

AB  - The sophistication of computational cognitive architectures has opened the door to model development across a range of human activity. However, a continuing challenge for model developers is validating the model both by exploring the range of a model's behavior and by optimizing mechanisms, knowledge, and parameters to best account for human cognition and performance. We have been developing an infrastructure to facilitate this process that takes advantage of high performance computing resources and technologies to allow for more ambitious model development and validation efforts. This work involves a combination of increased computational power and increased sophistication in running models using available resources. Examples of the promise of this work are presented, along with current areas of emphasis and future directions.
