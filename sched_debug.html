<h2>Scheduling server: debugging</h2>

<p>
The scheduling server uses assert to verify that arguments to functions have
valid values. Specifically, assert statements are used to verify that pointers
are not NULL and lengths are greater than zero. Error messages are also printed
to stderr, which is routed by Apache to the error log.
