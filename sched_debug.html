<h2>Scheduling Server: Debugging</h2> 
<p>
	The scheduling server uses assert to verify that arguments to
functions have valid values. Specifically, assert statements are used to
verify that pointers are not NULL and lengths are greater than zero.
Error messages are also printed to stderr, which is routed by Apache to
the error log.
