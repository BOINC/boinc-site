<h2>The BOINC application library</h2>

<p>
BOINC supplies a library that can be optionally used for
application development.
This library includes the following:
<ul>
<li> <b>Communication with the core client</b>.
Functions for parsing an initialization file
containing the checkpoint period.
Functions for checking for trigger files saying
when to exit, when to suspend computation,
and when to generate graphics.
Functions for writing files to report percentage done,
and to report errors.
<li> <b>Checkpoint/restart support</b>.
Simple support for writing output into memory buffers,
then appending them to output files and
writing the checkpoint file (almost atomic).
</ul>
