<title>The BOINC Application Program Interface (API)</title> 
<h2>The BOINC Application Programming Interface (API)</h2>

The BOINC API is a set of C++ functions.
Unless otherwise specified,
the functions return an integer error code; zero indicates success.
The graphics API is described <a href=graphics.html>separately</a>.

<h3>Initialization and termination</h3>
The application must call
<pre>
    int boinc_init(bool is_main_program, char** init_data_xml)
</pre>
before calling other BOINC functions or doing I/O.
<tt>is_main_program</tt> indicates whether the program
is the application's main program (normally true - see below).
Various information is returned in the malloced <tt>init_data_xml</tt>,
an XML string that may contain the following elements:
<pre>
    &lt;init_data>
        &lt;app_preferences>...&lt;/app_preferences>
        &lt;user_name>...&lt;/user_name>
        &lt;team_name>...&lt;/team_name>
        &lt;wu_cpu_time>...&lt;/wu_cpu_time>
        &lt;total_cobblestones>...&lt;/total_cobblestones>
        &lt;recent_avg_cobblestones>...&lt;/recent_avg_cobblestones>
    &lt;/init_data>
</pre>
<ul>
<li><b>app_preferences</b>: arbitrary text (generally XML);
the participant's preferences for this project.
<li><b>user_name</b>: the user's account name for this project
<li><b>team_name</b>: the user's team name, if any, for this project
<li><b>wu_cpu_time</b>: the CPU time used so far for this work unit
<li><b>total_cobblestones</b>: the user's total credit
<li><b>recent_avg_cobblestones</b>: the user's recent average credit
</ul>
<p>
These items might be used by the application in its graphics.
They can be parsed using the functions in lib/parse.C.
<p>
When the application has completed successfully it must call
<pre>
    int boinc_finish();
</pre>
before exiting.
An application that encounters a fatal error must call
<pre>
    void exit(int error);
</pre>

<h3>Resolving file names</h3>
Applications that use named input or output files must call
<pre>
    int boinc_resolve_filename(char *logical_name, char *physical_name);</tt>
</pre>
to convert logical file names to physical names.
For example, instead of
<pre>
    f = fopen("my_file", "r");
</pre>
</p>
the application might use
<p>
<pre>
    char resolved_name[256];
    retval = boinc_resolve_filename("my_file", resolved_name);
    if (retval) fail("can't resolve filename");
    f = fopen(resolved_name, "r");
</pre>
<tt>boinc_resolve_filename()</tt> doesn't need to be used for temporary files.

<h3>Checkpointing</h3>

Computations that use a significant amount of time
per work unit may want to periodically write the current
state of the computation to disk.
This is known as <b>checkpointing</b>.
The state file must include everything required
to start the computation again at the same place it was checkpointed.
On startup, the application
reads the state file to determine where to begin computation.
If the BOINC client quits or exits,
the computation can be restarted from the most recent checkpoint.

<p>
Do use checkpoint, an application should write to output and
state files using the <tt>MFILE</tt> class.
<pre>
class MFILE {
public:
    int open(char* path, char* mode);
    int _putchar(char);
    int puts(char*);
    int printf(char* format, ...);
    size_t write(const void* buf, size_t count);
    int close();
    int flush();
};
</pre>
MFILE buffers data in memory
and writes to disk only on <tt>flush()</tt> or <tt>close()</tt>.
This lets you write output files and state files
more or less atomically.
Frequency of checkpointing is a user preference
(e.g. laptop users might want to checkpoint infrequently).
An application must call
<pre>
    bool boinc_time_to_checkpoint();
</pre>
whenever it reaches a point where it is able to checkpoint.
If this returns true,
the application should write the state file and flush all output files,
then call
<pre>
    void boinc_checkpoint_completed();
</pre>

<h3>Fraction done</h3>
The core client GUI displays the percent done of workunits in progress.
To keep this display current, an application should
periodically call
<pre>
   boinc_percent_done(double fraction_done);
</pre>
The <tt>fraction_done</tt> argument is a rough estimate of the
workunit fraction complete (0 to 1).

<h3>Multi-program applications</h3>
Some applications consist of multiple programs:
a <b>main program</b> that acts as coordinator,
and one or more subsidiary programs.
Each program should use the BOINC API as described above,
using the appropriate argument to <tt>boinc_init()</tt>.
<p>
For checkpointing, each program has its own state file;
the state file of the coordinator program records
which subsidiary program was last active.
<p>
To correctly implement percent done,
the main program should pass information to subsidiary programs
(perhaps as command-line arguments) the starting and ending
fractions for that program.
<p>
The coordinator must call
<pre>
    boinc_child_start();
</pre>
prior to forking a child process.
When the child is done, the coordinator
must get the child's CPU time, then call
<pre>
    boinc_child_done(double total_CPU);
</pre>
before forking the next child process.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Application are executed in separate "catbox" directories,
allowing them to create and use temporary files without name conflicts.
Input and output files are kept outside the catbox.
The mappings from virtual to physical filenames use
"symbolic link" files in the catbox directory.
The name of such a file is the virtual name,
and it contains an XML tag with the physical name.
This scheme is necessary because of the lack of filesystem links
in Windows.

<p>
Communication between the core client and applications
is done through XML files in the catbox directory.
Several files are used.
<p>
<b>Files created by the core client, read by the app:</b>
(Once, at start of app)
<ul>
<li> Symbolic link files
<li> <b>fd_init.xml</b>:
specifies the mappings of file descriptors (stdin/stdout/stderr)
to physical files.

<li> <b>init_data.xml</b>: this contains the initialization data
returned by <tt>boinc_init()</tt> (see above),
as well as the minimum checkpoint period.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Files created by the API implementation, read by the core client:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>percent_done.xml</b>:
contains the WU percent done.
Written by the timer routine as needed.

<b>checkpoint_cpu.xml</b>
CPU time (from start of WU) at last checkpoint.
Written by checkpoint_completed.

</ul>
<p>
The API implementation uses a timer (60Hz);
the real-time clock is not available to applications.
This timer is used for several purposes:
<ul>
<li> To tell the app when to checkpoint;
<li> To regenerate the percent done file
<li> To refresh graphics
</ul>
