<title>Moving servers</title>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Announce to users there will be a black-out during this process
  <li>Disable all daemons, database access, etc.
  <li>Database:<p>
      Dump the old database on the old server and load it on the new server.
      <li>TODO FIXME
  <li>If moving upload/download locations:
    <ol>
      <li>Setup new location
      <li>Change URLs generated by results to new location.
      <li>Results already sent will go to the old location.  Until all these
          are flushed, the old URL must still work.  If you have NFS access
          you can symlink or mount the old download/upload directories to the
        new ones.  Or you could use an HTTP proxy setup.
    </ol>
