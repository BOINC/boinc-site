<p>
BOINC is used by many independent volunteer computing <b>projects</b>.
Some are based at universities and research labs,
others are run by companies and individuals.
You can participate in several projects (ensuring that
your computer will be kept busy even when one project has no work)
and you can control how your computer's resources
are divided among these projects.
<p>
In deciding whether to participate in a project,
read its web site and consider the following questions:

<ul>
<li> Does it clearly describe its goals,
    and are these goals important and beneficial?
<li> Do they have any published results? See
<a href=/wiki/Publications_by_BOINC_projects>
A list of scientific publications of BOINC projects</a>.
<li> Do you trust it to use proper security practices on its servers?
<li> Who owns the results of the computation?
  Will they be freely available to the public
  or will they belong to a for-profit business?
</ul>
<p>

We at BOINC have communicated with the following projects,
and we believe that their descriptions
(institution and area of research) are accurate.

<a href=wiki/Project_list>a complete list of projects</a>.

Note: if your computer is equipped with a Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU), you may be able to
<a href=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/gpu.php>use it to compute faster</a>.
