<h2>Installing BOINC</h2> 
<p>
	To use BOINC you must have the following software installed on a
server computer running Linux or Solaris: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		MySQL
	</li>
	<li>
		Apache with PHP
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Unzip and untar the BOINC release, and compile it by typing
"configure" and "make". To install in /usr/local/boinc, type "make
install". 
	<br>
	If Apache is configured to run with Fast CGI, rename fcgi to cgi in
the "boinc/sched" directory, replacing the existing cgi.
</p>
<p>
When installed there will be two directories created in your current directory,
"boinc_cvs/" and "boinc_server/".  <br>
"boinc_cvs/" will contain all the source
code in a directory called "boinc/".  <br>
"boinc_server/" will contain four directories, "upload/", "download/", "cgi/", and "keys/".  <br>
"upload/" and "cgi/"must be set as CGI in the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) and uploads must be allowed to the "upload/" directory.  <br>
Make sure to include something like:<br>
<p>alias /barry/ "/disks/philmor/a/users/barry/"<p>
or whichever directory contains "boinc_cvs/" and "boinc_server/".
	Edit your Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) 
to allow uploads to to the upload
directory.
</p>
<p>
	Add the following (with appropriate changes) to your .tcshrc
</p>
<pre>
setenv BOINC_DOWNLOAD_DIR   ~boinc_server/download
setenv BOINC_UPLOAD_DIR     ~boinc_server/upload
setenv BOINC_PLATFORM       sparc-sun-solaris2.7
setenv BOINC_EMAIL          barry@ssl.berkeley.edu
setenv BOINC_URL_BASE       http://maggie.ssl.berkeley.edu/barry/boinc_server/download
setenv BOINC_DB_NAME        boinc_barry
setenv BOINC_UPLOAD_URL     http://maggie.ssl.berkeley.edu/barry/boinc_server/cgi/file_upload_handler
setenv BOINC_DOWNLOAD_URL   http://maggie.ssl.berkeley.edu/barry/boinc_server/download
setenv BOINC_KEY            0xdabacafe
setenv BOINC_USER           barry
setenv BOINC_KEY_DIR        ~/boinc_server/keys
setenv BOINC_MASTER_URL     http:\\\/\\\/localhost\\\/
</pre>

setenv BOINC_DOWNLOAD_DIR /usr/local/boinc/download
</pre> This directory should be set to be web accessible via Apache. If
you plan on using a different directory, be sure to set the
BOINC_DOWNLOAD_DIR properly so as to point to the correct directory. It
is important that this directory is different from the BOINC_UPLOAD_DIR.
<pre>
BOINC_UPLOAD_DIR /usr/local/boinc/upload
</pre> This directory should be set to be web accessible via Apache. If
you plan on using a different directory, be sure to set the
BOINC_UPLOAD_DIR properly so as to point to the correct directory. It is
important that this directory is different from the BOINC_DOWNLOAD_DIR.
<pre>
BOINC_PLATFORM_NAME
</pre> This is set when configure is run in the client directory. It is
used by the client to determine the name of the BOINC client. <pre>
BOINC_EMAIL mgary@ssl.berkeley.edu
</pre> This is currently used by one of the test scripts. It is not
critical for the running of BOINC. <pre>
BOINC_URL_BASE http://localhost/download
</pre> This should be set to a url that points to the
BOINC_DOWNLOAD_DIR. Currently, this is the same as the
BOINC_DOWNLOAD_URL, although it may change in the future. <pre>
BOINC_KEY_DIR /usr/local/boinc/key_dir
</pre> This should be set to a directory in which the public and private
keys for BOINC are to be created. If you wish to place this in a
different directory, change the variable appropriately. <pre>
<b>setenv BOINC_KEY 0xdadacafe</b>
</pre> This should be set to any 32 bit hex value desired. To run
multiple instances of BOINC on one machine, each instance needs to have
a different BOINC_KEY compiled into it. 
<p>
	Go into the boinc/test directory, and type
</p>
<pre>
test_uc.php
</pre> This script runs a test case that initializes the database with a
user account, application and workunits, runs the client, and checks the
results.
