<h2>Installing BOINC</h2>

<p>
To use BOINC you must have the following software
installed on a server computer running Linux or Solaris:

<ul>
<li> MySQL
<li> Apache with PHP
</ul>

<p>
Unzip and untar the BOINC release, and compile it
by typing "configure" and "make".
<p>
Edit your Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) to
set the "boinc/sched" directory as CGI,
and to allow uploads to to the upload directory.

<p>
Go into the boinc/test directory, and type
<pre>
test_uc
</pre>

This script runs a test case that initializes the database
with a user account, application and workunits,
runs the client, and checks the results.
