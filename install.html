<ul>
<li> MySQL
<li> Apache with PHP
</ul>

<p>
Unzip and untar the BOINC release, and compile it
by typing "configure" and "make".
<p>
Edit your Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) to
set the "boinc/sched" directory as CGI,
and to allow uploads to to the upload directory.
<p>
Add the following (with appropriate changes) to your .tcshrc
<pre>

setenv BOINC_EMAIL          david@localhost.localdomain
setenv BOINC_URL_BASE       http://localhost.localdomain/download
</pre>

<p>
Go into the boinc/test directory, and type
