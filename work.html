<title>Compute Model: Workunits</title> 
<h2>Compute Model: Workunits</h2> 
<p>
A <b>workunit</b> describes a computation to be performed. Workunits
are maintained in the <b>workunit</b> table in the BOINC DB.
The attributes of a workunit include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Its application.
<li> Its name (unique across all workunits in the project).
<li> An XML document describing its input files and other parameters
(see below).
<li> The estimated resource requirements of the work unit
(computation, memory, disk space, network traffic).
<li> Counts of how many times this workunit should be dispatched, how
many times it has been dispatched, how many results have been returned,
and how many failures have occurred.
</ul>
<p>
The inputs to a workunit are described by an XML document of the form
<pre>
[ &lt;file_info&gt;...&lt;/file_info&gt; ]
[ ... ]
&lt;workunit&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;foobar&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;app_name&gt;blah&lt;/app_name&gt;
    [ &lt;version_num&gt;1&lt;/version_num&gt; ]
    [ &lt;command_line&gt;-flags xyz&lt;/command_line&gt; ]
    [ &lt;env_vars&gt;name=val&amp;name=val&lt;/env_vars&gt; ]
    [ &lt;file_ref&gt;...&lt;/file_ref&gt; ]
    [ ... ]
&lt;workunit&gt;
</pre>
The components are: 
<ul>
<li> The <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> element is the name of the workunit.
<li> The <b>&lt;app_name&gt;</b> element is the name of the
application.
<li> The <b>&lt;version_num&gt;</b> element is ???.
<li> The <b>&lt;command_line&gt;</b> element, if present, is the
command-line arguments to be passed to the main program.
<li> The <b>&lt;env_vars&gt;</b> element, if present, is a list of
environment variables to be passed to the main program.
<li> Each <b>&lt;file_ref&gt;</b> element describes a <a
href="files.html">reference</a> to an input file, each of which is
described by a <b>&lt;file_info&gt;</b> element.
</ul>
<p>
A workunit is associated with an application, not with a particular
version or set of versions???.
If the format of your input data changes in
a way that is incompatible with older versions, you must create a new
application.
This can often be avoided by using XML data format. 
<p>
The <a href="tools.html">create_work</a> utility program provides a
simplified interface for creating workunits.
