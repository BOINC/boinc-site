<h2>Workunits</h2> 
<p>
A <b>workunit</b> describes a computation to be performed.
The attributes of a workunit include:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>name</b>
<dd>
Unique across all workunits in the project.
<dt><b>application</b>
<dd>
Which application performs the computation.
A workunit is associated with an application, not with a particular
version or range of versions.
If the format of your input data changes in
a way that is incompatible with older versions,
you must create a new application.
This can often be avoided by using XML data format. 
<dt><b>input files</b>
<dd>
A list of its input files: their names,
and the names by which the application refers to them.
<dt><b>resource estimates</b>
<dd> The estimated resource requirements of the work unit
(computation, memory, disk space).
<dt><b>scheduling parameters</b>
<dd>
A <a href=wu_sched_params.html> set of parameters</a>
determining the redundancy and error policies for this work unit.

The <a href="tools_work.html">create_work</a> utility program provides a
simplified interface for creating workunits.
