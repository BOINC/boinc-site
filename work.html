<h2>Compute model: workunits and results</h2>

<p>
A <b>workunit</b> describes a computation to be performed.
The attributes of a workunit include:
<ul>
<li> The application it's associated with.
<li> Its name (unique across all workunits in the project).
<li> A list of its input files.
Each has an <b>input file association</b>
that specifies the filename or file descriptor number
by which the application will refer to the file.
<li> The command-line arguments to be passed to the application.
<li> The environment variables to be set for the application.
<li> The estimated resource requirements of the work unit
(computation, memory, disk space, network traffic).
</ul>

<p>
A workunit is associated with an application,
not with a particular version or set of versions.
If the format of your input data changes in a way that
is incompatible with older versions,
you must create a new application.
This can often be avoided by using XML-like data representations.
<p>

A <b>result</b> describes a particular instance of a computation,
either to be performed or already performed.
The attributes of a result include:
<ul>
<li> The workunit it's associated with.
<li> Its name (unique across all results in the project).
<li> A list of its output files.
Each has an <b>output file association</b>
that specifies the filename or file descriptor number
by which the application will refer to the file.
<li> Its <b>state</b>.  Values include:
<ul>
<li> Inactive (not ready to dispatch)
<li> Unsent (ready to dispatch, but not dispatched)
<li> In progress (dispatched, not done)
<li> Done successfully
<li> Timed out
<li> Done with error
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Several results may be associated with a single workunit.
Results may be generated in either of two ways
(selected as part of the application):
<ul>
<li> <b>Advance generation</b> of results.
One or more result records are stored in the database
when the workunit is produced.
The scheduling server dispatches each result to a single participant host.
When all result records have been dispatched,
participants hosts are "turned away".
<li> <b>On-demand generation</b> of results.
The application specifies a "result template",
which has place-holder tokens for the output filenames.
The scheduling server, in response to a host request,
generates a new result record and sends the result template.
The host generates unique output filenames,
and returns them along when it the computation is done.
</ul>

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between
workunits, results, files, and I/O assocations.
