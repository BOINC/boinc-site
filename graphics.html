<h2>BOINC Graphics</h2> 
<p>
Applications can optionally generate graphics,
which are displayed by the core client in either
its application (window) or screensaver (full-screen) form.

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<pre>
    void init_opengl(APP_IN_GRAPHICS);
    void draw_opengl();
    void gl_done();
<br>
</pre>
The application must supply a function
<pre>
    draw_gl();
</pre>
The <tt>draw_gl</tt> function is called when graphics
need to be drawn to the screen.
At the completion of the <tt>draw_gl</tt> function,
<tt>gl_done</tt> must be called.
