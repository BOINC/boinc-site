<h2>BOINC Graphics</h2> 
<p>
	Applications can optionally generate graphics, which are displayed
by the core client in either its application (window) or screensaver
(full-screen) form. 
</p>
<p>
	The graphics architecture has not been completed. It may differ
between platforms. Some possibilities:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Applications render their graphics into an offscreen buffer in
shared memory. The core client or screensaver BLITs this to the screen.
(Problem: no X11 toolkits let you render into memory in the client. Mesa
does, but that forces you to use OpenGL). 
	</li>
	<li>
		Applications are passed a window descriptor by the core client
or screensaver. Problem: can you do this in Windows? in X11? 
	</li>
	<li>
		Applications encode their rendering in a byte stream of some
sort (OpenGL had something like this), and send if through a pipe to the
core client or screensaver. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Applications supply their rendering code in a separate shared
library which is dynamically linked into the core client or screensaver,
and which communicates with the main application through shared memory.
This is how United Devices works. Disadvantage: complex. 
	</li>
</ul>
