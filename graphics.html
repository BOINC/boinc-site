<title>The BOINC graphics API</title>

<h2>The BOINC graphics API</h2> 
<p>
Applications can optionally generate graphics,
which are displayed either in an application window,
or in full-screen mode (screensaver).
<p>
If an application is able to generate graphics, it should call
<pre>
    void boinc_init_opengl();
</pre>
at the start and
<pre>
    void boinc_finish_opengl();
</pre>
at the end.
It must also supply a function
<pre>
    bool app_render(int xs, ys, double time_of_day);
</pre>
which will be called periodically.
This should make openGL calls to generate the current graphic.
<tt>xs</tt> and <tt>ys</tt> are the X and Y sizes of the window,
and <tt>time_of_day</tt> is the relative time.
The function should return true if it actually drew anything.
It can refer to the user name, CPU time etc. obtained from
<tt>boinc_init()</tt>.
<p>
<b>Give example here</b>
<p>
Applications that don't do graphics must also supply a
dummy <tt>app_render</tt> to link with the API.
<tt>boinc_draw_gl</tt> is called to draw graphics

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
The graphics API uses a file <b>graphics.xml</b>
that is created and occasionally modified by the
core client or screensaver.
This file has the format
<pre>
    &lt;graphics_info>
        &lt;do_graphics/>
        &lt;xsize>500&lt;/xsize>
        &lt;ysize>400&lt;/ysize>
        &lt;full_screen/>
    &lt;/graphics_info>
</pre>

<p>
The graphics API implementation uses a 60 Hz timer.
Every 0.5 sec, it sees if graphics.xml has been modified, and if so parses it.
Every 1/60 sec, it sees if it's time for a new frame,
and if so calls <tt>app_render()</tt>.
