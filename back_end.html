<title>Back End Examples</title> 
<h2>Back End Examples</h2> 
<p>
Here are some examples of the "back ends" that could be used by
various types of project. 
<p>
<b>SETI@home with local data servers</b> 
<ul>
<li> A <b>splitter program</b> generates data files. For each data
file, calls the BOINC server library to create a workunit record and
several result records, and stores the data file on disk of a data
server.
<li> A <b>garbage collector</b> program deletes data files for which
enough results have been returned.
Generates new result records as needed.
<li> A <b>result handler</b> program checks for new results. Parses
result files, and transfers contents to a separate "science database".
Does redundancy checking, and marks result records as valid or invalid.
</ul>
<p>
<b>SETI@home with remote data servers</b> 
<p>
As above, but the splitter program writes data files to DLT tape.
The result records are generated, using the URL of a selected data
server.
The tape is mailed to the data server.
An operator at the data
server transfers the files to disk, than uses a web control panel to
mark the batch as ready, which marks the result records as ready.
