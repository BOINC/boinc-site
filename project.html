<h2>Projects and applications</h2>
<p>
A <b>project</b> is an organization
(e.g., an academic research project) that uses BOINC to get computing power.
Projects are independent;
each one manages its own applications, databases and servers,
and is not affected by the status of other projects.

<p>
The components of a project are shown below.

<p>
The server side of a project consists of two parts:
<ul>
<li> A <b>project back end</b> part that generates
computation input files, and handles the output of computations,
in a way that depends on the particular application.
<li> A <b>BOINC server complex</b>
that handles data distribution and collection.
</ul>

The BOINC server complex includes the following components:
<ul>
<li> A <b>scheduling server</b> that communicates with participant hosts.
<li> A relational database storing information
about work, results, and participants.
<li> C and scripting-language interfaces for
communication with the project back end.
<li> Web interfaces for participants and developers.
</ul>

<p>
Input and output files are distributed by <b>data servers</b>,
which are HTTP servers able to handle uploads.
These servers need not be owned or operated by the project.
A project might, for example, recruit other organizations to
donate network bandwidth by hosting data servers;
data could be moved on tape between the project back end and the data servers.

<h3>Applications and platforms</h3>
<p>
A project can operate one or more <b>applications</b>.
Versions of an application are compiled for various <b>platforms</b>
(Windows/Intel, Linux/Intel, MacOS/PPC, etc.).
The BOINC core client is available for many platforms;
a project can compile an application for any or all of these.
