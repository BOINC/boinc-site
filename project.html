<h2>Projects and applications</h2>
<p>
A <b>project</b> is an organization that uses BOINC.
Projects are independent;
each one manages its own applications, databases and servers,
and is not affected by the status of other projects.
The components of a project are shown below.

<p>
The server side of a project consists of two parts:
<ul>
<li> A <b>project back end</b> that supplies
applications and work units,
and that handles the computational results.
Input and output files are distributed by <b>data servers</b>,
which are HTTP servers able to handle uploads.
These servers need not be owned or operated by the project.
A project might, for example, recruit other organizations to
donate network bandwidth by hosting data servers;
data could be moved on tape between the project back end and the data servers.
<li> A <b>BOINC server complex</b>
that manages data distribution and collection.
</ul>

The BOINC server complex includes the following components:
<ul>
<li> A <b>scheduling server</b> that communicates with participant hosts.
<li> A relational database storing information
about work, results, and participants.
<li> Utility programs and libraries that allow the
project back end to interact with the server complex.
<li> Web interfaces for participants and developers.
</ul>
