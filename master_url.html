<h2>The Master URL</h2> 
<p>
	Each project is identified by a <b>master URL</b>. This URL is used
to publicize the project. The <b>master page</b> at this URL has two
functions.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		It is the home page of the project; when viewed in a browser it
describes the project and contains links for registering and for
downloading the core client.
	</li>
	<li>
		It contains XML tags of the form <pre>
&lt;scheduler&gt;http://host.domain.edu/cgi/scheduler&lt;scheduler&gt;
&lt;scheduler&gt;http://host2.domain.edu/cgi/scheduler&lt;scheduler&gt;
</pre> that give the URLs of the project's scheduling servers. These
tags can be embedded within HTML comments. The BOINC core client reads
and parses the master page to find scheduler servers. If it is unable to
connect to any scheduler server for a project, it rereads the master
page.
	</li>
</ul>
This mechanism lets a project change the locations of its scheduling
servers, or add new servers.
