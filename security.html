<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
There are two major areas of security in public-participation
computing projects: protection of the project,
and protection of the participants.

<p>
BOINC's support for redundant computing allows projects
to protect themselves from forged results and credit cheating.
For most other types of attacks,
the project is responsible for its own security.
All machines other then the scheduling server,
web servers, and data servers should be protected by a firewall.
The machines outside the firewall should have
all unused network services disabled.
Access to these machines should be done only
with encrypted protocols like SSH.
The machines should be subjected to regular security audits.

<p>
The input and output files used by BOINC applications
are not encrypted.
Applications can do this themselves, but it has little effect
since data resides in cleartext in memory,
where it is easy to access with a debugger.

<p>
The most important aspect of participant protection
is the distribution of executables.
If this is hacked, BOINC projects could be used
to spread viruses to all their participants.
<p>
The mechanism for distributing executables is as follows:

<ul>
<li> The participants host contacts the scheduling server.
<li> The scheduling server passes back the URL and
MD5 checksum of an executable
(it gets this information from the BOINC database).
<li> The client downloads the executable from the dataserver
and computes its checksum.
If this doesn't match the one obtained from the server,
the client rejects the executable.
</ul>

<p>
Compromising the data server is not a danger.
However, if the scheduling server or the database is compromised
then BOINC could be used to distribute viruses.
Furthermore, if hackers were able to intercept and alter
network traffic between client and server,
they could substitute false checksums and break the system.

<p>
<b>TO DO: allow for separate "authentication servers" that
are used only to distribute MD5 checksums of executables;
clients can cross-check these if they want.</b>

<p>
Participants must understand that when they join a BOINC project,
they are entrusting that project with the security of their systems.
The BOINC documentation must emphasize this,
and projects must devote sufficient resources to ensure their security.
A successful attack could discredit all BOINC-based projects,
and public-participation computing in general.
