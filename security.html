<h2>Security</h2> 
<p>
    Many types of attacks are possible in public-participation
distributed computing. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Result falsification</b>. Attackers return incorrect results.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Credit falsification</b>. Attackers return results claiming
more CPU time than was actually used.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Malicious executable distribution</b>. Attackers break into a
BOINC server and, by modifying the database and files, attempt to
distribute their own executable (e.g. a virus program) disguised as a
BOINC application.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Overrun of data server</b>. Attackers repeatedly send large
files to BOINC data servers, filling up their disks and rendering them
unusable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Theft of participant account information by server
attack</b>. Attackers break into a BOINC server and steal email
addresses and other account information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Theft of participant account information by network
attack</b>. Attackers exploit the BOINC network protocols to steal
account information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Theft of project files</b>. Attackers steal input and/or
output files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Intentional abuse of participant hosts by projects</b>. A
project intentionally releases an application that abuses participant
hosts, e.g. by stealing sensitive information stored in files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Accidental abuse of participant hosts by projects</b>. A
project releases an application that unintentionally abuses particpant
hosts, e.g. deleting files or causing crashes.
    </li>
</ul>
BOINC provides mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of some of these
attacks. 
<p>
    <b>Result falsification</b> 
</p>
<p>
    This can be probabilistically detected using redundant computing and
result verification: if a majority of results agree (according to an
application-specific comparison) then they are classified as correct.
Also, ringers or similar schemes can be used to prevent cheating.  For
information about ringers see the paper "Uncheatable Distributed
Computations" by Philippe Golle and Ilya Mironov.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Credit falsification</b>
</p>
<p>
    This can be probabilistically detected using redundant computing and
credit verification: each participant is given the minimum credit from
among the correct results. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Malicious executable distribution</b>
</p>
<p>
    BOINC uses code signing to prevent this. Each project has a key pair
for code signing. The private key should be kept on a network-isolated
machine used for generating digital signatures for executables. The
public key is distributed to, and stored on, clients. All files
associated with application versions are sent with digital signatures
using this key pair.
</p>
<p>
    Even if attackers break into a project's BOINC servers, they will
not be able to cause clients to accept a false code file.
</p>
<p>
    BOINC provides a mechanism by which projects can periodically change
their code-signing key pair. The project generates a new key pair, then
(using the code-signing machine) generates a signature for the new
public key, signed with the old private key. The core client will accept
a new key only if it's signed with the old key. This mechanism is
designed to prevent attackers from breaking into a BOINC server and
distributing a false key pair. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Overrun of data server</b>
</p>
<p>
    Each result file has an associated maximum size. Each project has a
<b>upload authentication key pair</b>. The public key is stored on the
project's data servers. Result file descriptions are sent to clients
with a digital signature, which is forwarded to the data server when the
file is uploaded. The data server verifies the file description, and
ensures that the amount of data uploaded does not exceed the maximum
size. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theft of participant account information by server attack</b>
</p>
<p>
    Each project must address this using conventional security
practices. All server machines should be protected by a firewall, and
should have all unused network services disabled. Access to these
machines should be done only with encrypted protocols like SSH. The
machines should be subjected to regular security audits.
</p>
<p>
    Projects should be undertaken only the organizations that have
sufficient expertise and resources to secure their servers. A successful
attack could discredit all BOINC-based projects, and
public-participation computing in general. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theft of participant account information by network attack</b>
</p>
<p>
    The 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Theft of project files</b>
</p>
<p>
    The input and output files used by BOINC applications are not
encrypted. Applications can do this themselves, but it has little effect
since data resides in cleartext in memory, where it is easy to access
with a debugger. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Intentional abuse of participant hosts by projects</b>
</p>
<p>
    BOINC does nothing to prevent this (e.g. there is no "sandboxing" of
applications). Participants must understand that when they join a BOINC
project, they are entrusting the security of their systems to that
project. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Accidental abuse of participant hosts by projects</b>
</p>
<p>
    BOINC does nothing to prevent this. The chances of it happening can
be minimized by pre-released application testing. Projects should test
their applications thoroughly on all platforms and with all input data
scenarios before promoting them to production status.
