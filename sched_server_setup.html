<title>Setting up a scheduling server</title>
<h2>Setting up a scheduling server</h2>

<p>
The BOINC scheduling server runs as a CGI or fast CGI
program under Apache or similar web server.
It has been tested on Linux and Solaris.
The host must have access to the BOINC database.

<p>
The scheduling server uses an auxiliary program
called "feeder"; the two programs communicate
through a shared-memory segment.
<p>
The scheduling server and feeder programs are compiled
by typing "configure" and "make" in the sched/ directory.
Prior to doing this, you must define
the following environment variables:
<pre>
setenv BOINC_DB_NAME        boinc_barry
setenv BOINC_DB_PASSWD
setenv BOINC_SHMEM_KEY      0xdabacafe
setenv BOINC_KEY_DIR        /users/david/boinc_server/keys
</pre>
BOINC_DB_NAME and BOINC_DB_PASSWORD are the
name and password of the BOINC database.
<p>
BOINC_SHMEM_KEY is the identifier of the
shared-memory segment;
it is an arbitrary 32-bit quantity,
but must be unique among different BOINC servers
sharing a single host.
<p>
BOINC_KEY_DIR is the directory containing
the file upload authentication private key.

<p>
If any of these variables changes,
you must do a "make clean; make" in the sched directory.

<p>
You must modify your Apache config file
to allow execution of the scheduling server.
For example:

<pre>
ScriptAlias /boinc-cgi/ "/users/barry/cgi/"

&lt;Directory "/users/barry/cgi/">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
&lt;/Directory>
</pre>
