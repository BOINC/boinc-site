<h2>Compute Model: Handling Very Long Computations</h2> 
<p>
	Some applications have very long (multi-month) computations that
generate large amounts of local state, and therefore are most
efficiently done on a single host. 
</p>
<p>
	To accommodate such applications, BOINC allows workunits and results
to be linked together into <b>sequences</b>. Each workunit and result
may have a predecessor and a successor. 
</p>
<p>
	If a result A has a predecessor B, the scheduling server will
dispatch A only to the host that has handled (or is currently handling)
B. If result A times out, then the scheduling server will dispatch B to
any eligible host.
