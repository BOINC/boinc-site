<pre>APP_VERSION</pre>
<pre>IO_FILE_DESC</pre>

command line arguments, environment variables and required
input files.  Also points to the application, app
version and project the workunit is associated with.
<pre>RESULT</pre>
Contains status information about result including
state, total CPU time, deadline, etc.  Also points
to the workunit, application and project the result is

<pre>PREFS</pre>
Contains a vector of PROJECTs, summarizing the prefs.xml
file.  Also contains user preferences.
<pre>CLIENT_STATE</pre>
