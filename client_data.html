<h2>Core client: data structures</h2>

<p>
The key data structures in the core client are as follows.

<p>
Basic types:
<pre>
PROJECT
APP
FILE_INFO
APP_VERSION
IO_FILE_DESC
WORKUNIT
RESULT
</pre>

<pre>ACCOUNTS</pre>
Contains a vector of PROJECTs, summarizing the accounts file.
<p>
<pre>CLIENT_STATE</pre>
<p>
Contains vectors of all the basic types.
These are crossed-linked with pointers;
for example, APP_VERSION has a pointer to FILE_INFO.

Also contains FSM sets for network connections,
HTTP operations, file transfers, and active tasks.
