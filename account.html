<h2>Joining a project</h2>

<p>
A participant joins a BOINC project as follows:
<ol>
<li> Visit the project's web site and create an <b>account</b>.
This involves filling out a form with
<ul>
<li> An email address.
<li> A public "screen name" (real name or nickname).
<li> A web password (chosen by the user).
This is used to access the account via the project's web site.
<li> Country (optional)
<li> Postal Code (optional)
</ul>

<li> Receive an email containing an <b>account ID</b>,
aka <b>authenticator</b> (a long random string).

<li> Download and install the BOINC client program.
It will ask for an account ID;
cut and paste the one in the email.

</ol>
The BOINC client resides in a <b>BOINC home directory</b>.
If hosts share a network file system,
each host must have its own BOINC home directory. 

<h3>Multiple hosts under one account</h3>
<p>
A single account can use many hosts.
Once an account has been created as above,
new hosts can be added in either of two ways:

<ol>
<li> Download and install the BOINC client program,
and cut and paste the account ID as above.

<li> If the new host is the same type as an existing host,
copy the contents of the BOINC installation directory
from an existing host to the new host.

</ol>
