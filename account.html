<h2>Participant accounts</h2>

<p>
Each participant has a separate <b>account</b>
with each project in which they participate.
An account consists of:

<ul>
<li> An email address.
<li> A public "screen name" (real name or nickname)
<li> A web password (chosen by the user)
<li> An authenticator (a 32-byte string assigned by the project)
</ul>

<p>
A participant's accounts are described in an <b>account file</b>
on each of their hosts.
This file looks like this:

<pre>
&lt;accounts>
    &lt;project>
        &lt;home_project/>
        &lt;domain>setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/domain>
        &lt;scheduler_url>http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/boinc-cgi/cgi&lt;/scheduler_url>
        &lt;authenticator>3f7b90793a0175ad0bda68684e8bd136&lt;/authenticator>
    &lt;/project>
    &lt;project>
        &lt;domain>bio.wwu.edu&lt;/domain>
        &lt;scheduler_url>http://bio.wwu.edu/boinc-cgi/cgi&lt;/scheduler_url>
        &lt;authenticator>3f7b90793a0175ad0bda68684e8bd136&lt;/authenticator>
    &lt;/project>
&lt;/accounts>
</pre>

<p>
One account can be designated as the <b>home project</b>;
this is the project where the user maintains their preferences.
