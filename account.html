<h2>Joining a project</h2>

<p>
You can join a BOINC project as follows:
<ol>
<li> Visit the project's web site and create an <b>account</b>.
This involves filling out a form with
<ul>
<li> An email address.
<li> A public "screen name" (real name or nickname).
This also serves as your login name for the project's web site.
<li> A web password
(used to log in to the project's web site).
<li> Country (optional)
<li> Postal Code (optional)
</ul>

<li> You will receive an email containing an <b>account ID</b>
(a long random string).

<li> Download and install the BOINC client program.
It will ask for a project URL and an account ID.
Enter the project's URL,
cut and paste the account ID from the email.

</ol>
<p>
That's it!
You can go to the project web site to set your
<b>user preferences</b>.

<h3>Multiple hosts under one account</h3>
<p>
You can run BOINC on many hosts, all under one account.
Once you have created an account as above,
you can add new hosts in either of two ways:

<ol>
<li> Download and install the BOINC client program on each host,
and cut and paste the project URL and account ID as above.

<li> If the new host is the same type as an existing host,
copy the contents of the BOINC installation directory
from an existing host to the new host.

</ol>

The BOINC client resides in a <b>BOINC home directory</b>.
If hosts share a network file system,
each host must have its own BOINC home directory.
