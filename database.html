<title>The BOINC Database</title> 
<h2>The BOINC Database</h2> 
<p>
BOINC uses a relational database to keep track of participants, work
and result.
The reference implementation uses MySQL, but any SQL database can be used. 
<p>
In boinc/html_user/ there is a file called db_name containing only the
name of the database for that project.
Each BOINC project will have a different database name.
This allows for access to different databases through the webpages of projects.
<p>
The database tables are as follows: 
<dl>
<dt> platform
<dd> Compilation targets of the core client and/or applications.
<dt> app
<dd> Applications. The core client is treated as an application; its
name is "core_client".
<dt> app_version
<dd> Versions of applications. Each record includes a URL for
downloading the executable, and the MD5 checksum of the executable. 
<dt> user
<dd> Describes users, including their email address, name, web
password, and authenticator. 
<dt> preferences
<dd> Describes preferences. The actual preference information is
stored in an XML document in a "blob" field of this table. 
<dt> host
<dd> Describes hosts. 
<dt> workunit
<dd> Describes workunits. The input file descriptions are stored in
an XML document in a blob field. Includes counts of the number of
results linked to this workunit, and the numbers that have been sent,
that have succeeded, and that have failed. 
<dt> result
<dd> Describes results. Includes a "state" (whether the result has
been dispatched). Stores a number of items relevant only after the
result has been returned: CPU time, exit status, and validation status.
