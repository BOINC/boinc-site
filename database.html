<h2>The BOINC Database</h2> 
<p>
	BOINC uses a relational database to keep track of participants, work
and result. The reference implementation uses MySQL, but any SQL
database can be used. 
</p>
<p>
        In boinc/html_user/ there is a file called db_name containing only the
name of the database for that project.  Each BOINC project will have a different database
name.  This allows for access to different databases through the webpages of projects.
<p>
	The database tables are as follows: 
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		platform
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Compilation targets of the core client and/or applications.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		app
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Applications. The core client is treated as an application; its
name is "core_client".
	</dd>
	<dt>
		app_version
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Versions of applications. Each record includes a URL for
downloading the executable, and the MD5 checksum of the executable. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
		user
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Describes users, including their email address, name, web
password, and authenticator. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
		preferences
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Describes preferences. The actual preference information is
stored in an XML document in a "blob" field of this table. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
		host
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Describes hosts. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
		workunit
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Describes workunits. The input file descriptions are stored in
an XML document in a blob field. Includes counts of the number of
results linked to this workunit, and the numbers that have been sent,
that have succeeded, and that have failed. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
		result
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Describes results. Includes a "state" (whether the result has
been dispatched). Stores a number of items relevant only after the
result has been returned: CPU time, exit status, and validation status. 
	</dd>
