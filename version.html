<h2>Versioning</h2>

<p>
Each version of an application is assigned an integer <b>version number</b>.
Projects can assign version numbers however they like;
for example, version 304 might represent major version 3 and minor version 4.
Version numbers should be used consistently across platforms;
Windows version 304 should be functionally identical to Mac version 304.
