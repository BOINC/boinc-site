<h2>Compute model: storage</h2>

<h3>Files</h3>
<p>
The BOINC storage model is based on <b>files</b>.
The inputs and outputs of applications,
and the applications executables, are files.
<p>
A file is described by an XML element of the form
<pre>
&lt;file_info>
    &lt;name>foobar&lt;/name>
    &lt;url>http://a.b.c/foobar&lt;/url>
    &lt;url>http://x.y.z/foobar&lt;/url>
    ...
    &lt;md5_cksum>123123123123&lt;/md5_cksum>
    &lt;nbytes>134423&lt;/nbytes>
    [ &lt;executable/> ]
    [ &lt;upload_when_present/> ]
    [ &lt;sticky/> ]
&lt;/file_info>
</pre>
The components are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
The <b>&lt;name></b> element gives the file's name,
which must be unique within the project.

<li> Each <b>&lt;url></b> element gives a URL
where the file is (or will be) located on a data server.
<li> The <b>&lt;md5_cksum></b> element
is the MD5 checksum of the file,
providing protection against corruption and spoofing.
<li> The <b>&lt;nbytes></b> element is the size of the file in bytes
(may be greater than 2^32).
<li> The <b>&lt;sticky></b> element, if present,
indicates that the file should be retained on the client
after its initial use.
<li> The <b>&lt;upload_when_present></b> element, if present,
indicates that the file should be uploaded after it is created.
<li> The <b>&lt;executable></b> element,
if present, indicates that the file protections
should be set to allow execution.
</ul>

These attributes allow the specification of various types of files:
for example, input or output files that are retained for
use as input to later computations.

<p>
Once a file is created (on a data server or a participant host)
it is immutable.

<h3>File references</h3>
<p>
Files may be associated with
<a href=work.html>workunits</a>,
<a href=result.html>results</a> and
<a href=app.html>application versions</a>.
Each such association is represented by an XML element of the form

<pre>
&lt;file_ref>
    &lt;file_name>foobar&lt;/file_name>
    [ &lt;open_name>input&lt;/open_name> ]
    [ &lt;fd>2&lt;/fd> ]
    [ &lt;main_program/> ]
&lt;/file_ref>
</pre>

The components are as follows:
<ul>
<li> The <b>&lt;file_name></b> element specifies a file.
<li> The <b>&lt;open_name></b> element, if present,
is the name by which the application will refer to the file
(in a call to <b>fopen()</b>, for example).
<li> The <b>&lt;fd></b> element, if present,
indicates the file descriptor number by which the application
will access the file.
<li> The <b>&lt;main_program></b> element is used for
files associated with application versions.
It indicates that this file is the application's main program.
</ul>
