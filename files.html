<h2>Compute Model: Storage</h2>
<h3>Files</h3> 
<p>
The BOINC storage model is based on <b>files</b>.
The inputs and
outputs of applications, and the applications executables, are files.
<p>
A file is described by an XML element of the form 
<pre>
&lt;file_info&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;foobar&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;http://a.b.c/foobar&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;http://x.y.z/foobar&lt;/url&gt;
    ...
    &lt;md5_cksum&gt;123123123123&lt;/md5_cksum&gt;
    &lt;nbytes&gt;134423&lt;/nbytes&gt;
    &lt;max_nbytes&gt;200000&lt;/max_nbytes&gt;
    [ &lt;executable/&gt; ]
    [ &lt;upload_when_present/&gt; ]
    [ &lt;sticky/&gt; ]
&lt;/file_info&gt;
</pre>
The components are as follows: 
<ul>
<li> The <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> element gives the file's name, which
must be unique within the project.
<li> Each <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> element gives a URL where the file is
(or will be) located on a data server.
<li> The <b>&lt;md5_cksum&gt;</b> element is the MD5 checksum of the
file, providing protection against corruption and spoofing.
<li> The <b>&lt;nbytes&gt;</b> element is the size of the file in
bytes (may be greater than 2^32).
<li> The <b>&lt;max_nbytes&gt;</b> element is the maximum allowable
size of the file in bytes (may be greater than 2^32).
This is used to prevent flooding data servers with bogus data.
<li> The <b>&lt;sticky&gt;</b> element, if present, indicates that
the file should be retained on the client after its initial use.
<li> The <b>&lt;upload_when_present&gt;</b> element, if present,
indicates that the file should be uploaded after it is created.
<li> The <b>&lt;executable&gt;</b> element, if present, indicates
that the file protections should be set to allow execution.
</ul>
These attributes allow the specification of various types of files: for
example, input or output files that are retained for use as input to
later computations.
<p>
Once a file is created (on a data server or a participant host) it
is immutable.
<h3>File references</h3> 
<p>
Files may be associated with <a href="work.html">workunits</a>,
<a href="result.html">results</a> and
<a href="app.html">application versions</a>.
Each such association is represented by an XML element of the form 
<pre>
&lt;file_ref&gt;
    &lt;file_name&gt;foobar&lt;/file_name&gt;
    [ &lt;open_name&gt;input&lt;/open_name&gt; ]
    [ &lt;fd&gt;2&lt;/fd&gt; ]
    [ &lt;main_program/&gt; ]
&lt;/file_ref&gt;
</pre>
The components are as follows: 
<ul>
<li> The <b>&lt;file_name&gt;</b> element specifies a file.
<li> The <b>&lt;open_name&gt;</b> element, if present, is the name by
which the application will refer to the file (in a call to
<b>fopen()</b>, for example).
Note that this file will usually be a
BOINC soft link rather than the actual file.
<li> The <b>&lt;fd&gt;</b> element, if present, indicates the file
descriptor number by which the application will access the file.
This file descriptor will only be set up if the application calls the API
function <tt>boinc_init</tt>.
<li> The <b>&lt;main_program&gt;</b> element is used for files
associated with application versions.
It indicates that this file is the application's main program.
</ul>
