<h2>Participant Startup</h2> 
<p>
	The BOINC core client is run in a <b>BOINC home directory</b>. On
hosts that share a network file system, each host must have its own
BOINC home directory. 
</p>
<p>
	The use of "proxy" servers (such as SETI@home's SETIQueue) serves
two purposes: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		To buffer input and output data, allowing hosts to work for long
periods without connecting to the Internet, or when the project's
servers are down.
	</li>
	<li>
		To support hosts that are not connected to the Internet.
	</li>
</ul>
BOINC's high/low water mark scheme performs the first function. The
second function would be hard to do; the proxy server would have to
parse the XML descriptions of workunits and results, and would interact
with data servers.
