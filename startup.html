<p>
The BOINC core client is run in a <b>BOINC home directory</b>.
On hosts that share a network file system,
each host must have its own BOINC home directory.


<p>
The use of "proxy" servers
(such as SETI@home's SETIQueue) serves two purposes:
<ul>
<li> To buffer input and output data,
allowing hosts to work for long periods without connecting to the Internet,
or when the project's servers are down.
<li> To support hosts that are not connected to the Internet.
</ul>
BOINC's high/low water mark scheme performs the first function.
The second function would be hard to do;
the proxy server would have to parse the XML descriptions
of workunits and results, and would interact with data servers.
