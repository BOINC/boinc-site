<h2>Participating in multiple projects</h2> 
<p>

A participant can join a second and subsequent projects as follows.
<ol>
<li> Visit the second project's web site and create an account.
<li> Receive an email containing an account ID (a long random string).
<li> Visit the original project's web site
and log in to the original account.
Click on Edit Preferences.
Click on Add Project.
Enter the URL of the second projects,
and the new account ID.
<li> Enter resource shares for each of the projects.

</ol>

This procedure adds the new project to the participant's preferences,
which will be propagated to all the participant's hosts.
There is therefore no need to perform any manual operation
on all of the hosts.


<h3>Maintaining consistent preferences</h3>
<p>
If a participant joins multiple project,
his/her preferences will be propagated to all the projects,
and can be edited on the web sites of any project.
Propagation may take several hours or days.
If preferences are edited at one project,
then edited soon thereafter at another project,
the first edits may be overwritten and lost.
This can be avoided by only editing preferences at one project.

<p>
Some projects may provide a web interface
for editing their project-specific preferences.
In this case it may be necessary to edit preferences at different sites.
To avoid overwriting edits,
wait until previous edits have propagated to a site
before editing preferences there.
