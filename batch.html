<h2>Batches</h2>
<p>
Workunits and results can be grouped together into <b>batches</b>.
Each batch is represented by an integer.
Results must belong to the same batch as their workunit.

<p>
BOINC provides tools for manipulating
workunits and results by batch:
e.g., for changing the status of all results in
a batch from "inactive" to "unsent".
