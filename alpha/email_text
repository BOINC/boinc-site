Subject: BOINC Alpha Test status

Dear (name):

Please help us complete the testing of BOINC version 7.4.23.
To do this:

- Download the software from http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php

- Perform the tests described at
  http://boinc.berkeley.edu/alpha/test_matrix.php
  Do whatever tests you can; you don't need to do all of them.

- Report the outcomes of your tests - positive or negative - at
  http://boinc.berkeley.edu/alpha/test_form.php

We need positive test results to be confident that BOINC will
work correctly on the wide range of volunteer computers.
We release a version only when we have
at least 5 positive results for each test and computer type.

The testing of version 7.4.23 is currently 8% complete.
When this reaches 100% we can release it to the public.

Your history of BOINC Alpha testing is:

Joined: 7 July 2010
Number of test results reported: 10
Last test result reported: 9 Dec 2011

The BOINC Alpha email list is used to announce new versions for testing
and to discuss bugs and design issues.

If you are unable to continue testing BOINC and want to
stop getting emails about it, please notify me or David.

Thanks for your help.
