<h2>Measuring and distinguishing hosts</h2> 

<p>
The core client measures the following aspects of each host:

<ul>
<li> CPU performance: integer ops/sec, double-precision floating-point
ops/sec, and memory bandwidth are measured separately.
They are measured by a process executing at the same priority
as BOINC applications,
so the results will be affected by other processes.
These measurements are taken at random intervals.
<li> Number of CPUs.
<li> Vendor and model of CPU.
<li> Disk space: free and total.
<li> Memory: total RAM, CPU cache, and swap space.
<li> Timezone.
<li> Last IP address, and count of consecutive same addresses.
<li> Number of RPCs and time of last RPC.
<li> Fractions of time that core client runs on host,
host is connected, and user is active.
These are computed as exponentially-weighted averages;
see the class TIME_STATS.
<li> Operating system name and version.
<li> Average up- and downstream network bandwidth.
These are computed as exponentially-weighted averages;
see the class NET_STATS.
</ul>

These quantities are reported in every scheduling RPC,
and their latest values are stored in the BOINC database.

<h3>Distinguishing hosts</h3>
<p>
Not all systems have an application-readable globally unique ID,
so we don't take this approach.
When a host first contacts the scheduling server it
is assigned a host ID, which it stores in its "state.xml" file.

<p>
The BOINC database maintains the RPC sequence number for each host,
and the host maintains the sequence number in its state.xml file.
<p>
To install the BOINC client on a large number of computers,
users are instructed to copy only the executable
and the "account.xml" file.
If the user copies the state.xml file as well,
the first RPCs from the other hosts will have
a repeat sequence number; in this case the scheduling server
creates a new host record and returns its ID.
